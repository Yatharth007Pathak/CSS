/*
In this CSS code, an animation moves the div element horizontally from left: 0px to left: 200px in an alternating motion, 
creating a back-and-forth effect. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key parts:

Animation Properties:
animation-name: colorAnimate;: Sets the animation's name to colorAnimate.
animation-duration: 3s;: Each animation cycle lasts 3 seconds.
animation-delay: 0s;: Starts immediately with no delay.
animation-iteration-count: infinite;: The animation loops endlessly.
animation-direction: alternate;: The animation alternates direction, moving forward from 0px to 200px, then reversing back from 200px to 0px.

Keyframes:
@keyframes colorAnimate: Defines the animation's motion path.
from { left: 0px; } to to { left: 200px; }: Specifies the horizontal movement of the div, with the left property shifting from 0px to 200px.

The result is a smooth, continuous horizontal sliding effect where the div moves back and forth across 200px of space.
