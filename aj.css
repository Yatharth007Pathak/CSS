/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules using the universal selector (*) and a specific selector for the <h1> element:

1. Universal Selector: * { color: darkred; }

* {
The asterisk (*) is the universal selector. It selects all elements in the HTML document.

color: darkred;
This sets the text color of all elements to dark red.

}
This closing curly brace ends the rule for all elements.

2. Specific Selector: h1 { color: blue; }

h1 {
The selector h1 specifically targets all <h1> elements in the document.

color: blue;
This sets the text color of <h1> elements to blue.

}
This closing curly brace ends the rule for the <h1> element.

Summary:
The universal selector (*) applies a dark red color to all text in the document.
The specific rule for <h1> elements overrides the universal rule, changing the text color of <h1> elements to blue. 
Thus, any <h1> element will display its text in blue, while all other text will be in dark red.
