/*
In CSS, the font-style property is used to specify the style of the font, such as making the text italic or oblique. 
Here are the common values:

normal: The default font style, with no italicization.

italic: Italicizes the text, giving it a slanted, cursive look.

oblique: Similar to italic but slants the text slightly without necessarily using a cursive style. 
Some fonts may not have a true italic style and will use an oblique version instead.

oblique [angle] (CSS3): You can specify an angle for the oblique slant. 
For example, oblique 20deg would slant the text by 20 degrees. However, this feature isn't supported by all browsers.

Note
The italic style is more widely used and better supported across fonts compared to oblique.
If a font doesn't have an italic or oblique variant, browsers will usually simulate it by slanting the text.

#one {
    font-style: italic;
}

#two {
    font-style:  normal;

#three {
    font-style: oblique;

#four {
    font-style: oblique 20deg;

/*

Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rules that set different font styles for various IDs (#one, #two, #three, and #four):

1. #one { font-style: italic; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID one.
Property: font-style: italic;
This applies an italic style to the text, which is a slanted version of the text, often used for emphasis.

2. #two { font-style: normal; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID two.
Property: font-style: normal;
This sets the font style to normal, which is the default, upright style of the text. This is used to remove any italic or oblique styling.

3. #three { font-style: oblique; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID three.
Property: font-style: oblique;
This applies an oblique style, which is similar to italic, but typically the text is slanted more artificially. 
The degree of slant may vary based on the font.

4. #four { font-style: oblique 20deg; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID four.
Property: font-style: oblique 20deg;
This applies an oblique style with a custom slant of 20 degrees. 
You can specify the angle of the slant (in degrees) to control how much the text is tilted.

Summary:
#one: Applies an italic style, making the text slanted.
#two: Resets the text to the normal, upright style.
#three: Applies an oblique style, slanting the text like italic but with a different visual effect.
#four: Applies an oblique style with a slant of 20 degrees, giving you control over the tilt angle.
These rules allow you to stylize text in different ways—italic for emphasis, oblique for a unique slanted effect, 
or normal to reset the text to its default style. The custom angle for oblique provides additional flexibility in design.
