/*
You can also combine text-decoration with additional properties like text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style, 
and text-decoration-thickness for more customization:
*/

.text {
    text-decoration: underline; /* Underline the text */
    text-decoration-color: red; /* Change the color of the underline */
    text-decoration-style: dashed; /* Change the style of the underline */
    text-decoration-thickness: 2px; /* Change the thickness of the underline */
}

/*
Breakdown:

.text {
This selector targets all elements that have the class text. It will apply the following styles to any HTML element with this class.

text-decoration: underline;
This property applies an underline to the text. It indicates that the text will be underlined.

text-decoration-color: red;
This property changes the color of the underline to red. 
This is a specific style that allows you to customize the color of the text decoration independently from the text color itself.

text-decoration-style: dashed;
This property changes the style of the underline to dashed. The possible values for this property include solid, dotted, dashed, and wavy. 
This allows for different visual effects for the underline.

text-decoration-thickness: 2px;
This property sets the thickness of the underline to 2 pixels. This allows for customization of how thick or thin the underline appears, 
giving more control over the visual presentation of the text decoration.

}
This closing curly brace ends the rule for the .text class.
