/*
In CSS, the text-decoration property is used to set decorations on text, such as underlines, overlines, line-throughs, and more. 
Here are the common values you can use with this property:

Basic Values

None: No decoration.

Underline: Adds a line below the text.

Overline: Adds a line above the text.

Line-through: Adds a line through the text.

h1 {
    text-decoration: none;
}

h2 {
    text-decoration: underline;
}

h3 {
    text-decoration: overline;
}

h4 {
    text-decoration: line-through;
}


/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules that apply different text decorations to various heading elements (h1, h2, h3, and h4):

1. h1 { text-decoration: none; }

Selector: Targets all <h1> elements.
Property: text-decoration: none;
This removes any text decoration from the text within <h1> elements. By default, headings do not have text decorations, 
so this rule explicitly states that no decoration (like underlining) should be applied.

2. h2 { text-decoration: underline; }
Selector: Targets all <h2> elements.
Property: text-decoration: underline;
This applies an underline to the text within <h2> elements. This can help emphasize the heading and distinguish it visually.

3. h3 { text-decoration: overline; }
Selector: Targets all <h3> elements.
Property: text-decoration: overline;
This applies an overline to the text within <h3> elements. 
An overline appears above the text and can be used for stylistic purposes or to indicate a heading.

4. h4 { text-decoration: line-through; }
Selector: Targets all <h4> elements.
Property: text-decoration: line-through;
This applies a line-through (strikethrough) effect to the text within <h4> elements. 
This style can indicate that the text is crossed out or no longer relevant.
