/*
In CSS, the text-transform property is used to control the capitalization of text. 
It can be applied to any text-containing element and has several values:


Values of text-transform

none: No transformation. Text appears as it is.

capitalize: Capitalizes the first letter of each word in the text.

uppercase: Converts all characters in the text to uppercase.

lowercase: Converts all characters in the text to lowercase.


The text-transform property is purely a visual change and does not alter the underlying HTML content. 
For example, if you have text that is originally "Hello World", using text-transform: uppercase; will display it as "HELLO WORLD", 
but the actual HTML remains "Hello World".
This property is useful for creating consistent styling for headings and other text elements without needing to change the actual content.

#h1 {
    text-transform: none;
}

#h2 {
    text-transform: capitalize;
}

#h3 {
    text-transform: uppercase;
}

#h4 {
    text-transform: lowercase;
}

/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules that set different text transformation styles for various IDs (#h1, #h2, #h3, and #h4):

1. #h1 { text-transform: none; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h1.
Property: text-transform: none;
This keeps the text as it is, without any transformation. The original casing of the text will be displayed.

2. #h2 { text-transform: capitalize; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h2.
Property: text-transform: capitalize;
This capitalizes the first letter of each word in the text. For example, "hello world" would be transformed to "Hello World".

3. #h3 { text-transform: uppercase; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h3.
Property: text-transform: uppercase;
This transforms all letters in the text to uppercase. For example, "hello world" would be transformed to "HELLO WORLD".

4. #h4 { text-transform: lowercase; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h4.
Property: text-transform: lowercase;
This transforms all letters in the text to lowercase. For example, "HELLO WORLD" would be transformed to "hello world".


Summary:
#h1: Keeps the original text casing with no transformation.
#h2: Capitalizes the first letter of each word, enhancing the visual appeal of titles or headings.
#h3: Converts all text to uppercase, making it stand out and giving a bold look.
#h4: Converts all text to lowercase, providing a softer appearance compared to uppercase.
