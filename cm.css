p {
    border: 30px solid transparent;
    border-image: url('images/border1.jpeg') 30 round;
}

/*
The p element has a 30-pixel transparent border that is replaced by a border image sourced from 'images/OIP.jpeg'. 
The image is sliced into 30-pixel sections and tiled (repeated) around the element's border using the round keyword. 
This creates a visually distinct border around the paragraph, where the image wraps around all sides.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule applied to a p element:

1. border: 30px solid transparent;
Property: border
Creates a 30-pixel-wide transparent border around the p element.
The solid transparent ensures that the border is initially invisible, setting up the space for the image border.

2. border-image: url('images/border1.jpeg') 30 round;
Property: border-image
Specifies the image (border1.jpeg from the images/ folder) to be used as the border.
The 30 defines the slice size of the image, meaning 30 pixels from the edge of the image will be used for the border.
The round value instructs the browser to tile (repeat) the image if needed to fill the border area, making it fit the full length of the sides.
