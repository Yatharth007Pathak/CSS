/*
box-sizing and Height:
By default, the height property only affects the content area of an element. 
However, if you set the box-sizing property to border-box, the padding and border are included in the element’s total height.
*/

div {
    height: 300px;
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: aquamarine;
    border: 5px solid black;
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Includes padding and border in the height */
}

/*
The div has a 300px height and 20px padding, with a 5px solid black border.
By using box-sizing: border-box;, the total height of the div is 300px, 
and this value includes the padding and border, making it easier to manage the overall size of the element.


Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rule that applies styles to a div element with a focus on the box-sizing property:

1. height: 300px;
Property: height
This sets the height of the div element to 300 pixels.
Without box-sizing: border-box;, this would only account for the content area and exclude padding and border.

2. padding: 20px;
Property: padding
Adds 20 pixels of internal spacing between the content and the border of the div.
Without box-sizing: border-box;, this padding would increase the overall size of the div.

3. background-color: aquamarine;
Property: background-color
This sets the background color of the div to aquamarine.
The entire background of the div will be filled with this color, making the element visually distinct.

4. border: 5px solid black;
Property: border
Adds a 5-pixel solid black border around the div.
Without box-sizing: border-box;, the border would also add to the overall size of the element.

5. box-sizing: border-box;
Property: box-sizing
Value: border-box
This CSS property ensures that the padding and border are included in the height and width of the element.
With box-sizing: border-box;, the div remains 300px in height despite the padding and border. Without it, 
the total height would be 300px (content) + 20px (padding, top) + 20px (padding, bottom) + 5px (border, top) + 5px (border, bottom) = 350px.
