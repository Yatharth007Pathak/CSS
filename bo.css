/*
In CSS, the letter-spacing property is used to control the space between characters in a text. 
It can help improve readability or create a specific visual effect in typography.
Basic Syntax
letter-spacing: value;

Values for letter-spacing

Normal: The default spacing between letters (no additional spacing).

Length: You can specify the spacing using a fixed length, such as px, em, or rem. 
Positive values increase the spacing, while negative values decrease it.

Notes
Adjusting letter spacing can improve the legibility of text, especially in larger fonts or in specific design contexts.
Be cautious with negative letter spacing, as it can cause letters to overlap and become difficult to read.
The effects of letter spacing can vary based on the font being used, so it’s good practice to test the appearance across different fonts.

#h1 {
    letter-spacing: 4px; /* Adds 4 pixels of space between letters */
}

#h2 {
    letter-spacing: normal; /* No additional spacing */
}

#h3 {
    letter-spacing: -0.5px; /* Reduces space between letters by 0.5 pixels */
}


/*
Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rules that set different letter spacing styles for various IDs (#h1, #h2, and #h3):

1. #h1 { letter-spacing: 4px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h1.
Property: letter-spacing: 4px;
This adds 4 pixels of space between each letter in the text. 
This can enhance readability for certain fonts and styles, or it can create a more dramatic visual effect in headings.

2. #h2 { letter-spacing: normal; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h2.
Property: letter-spacing: normal;
This sets the letter spacing to normal, meaning no additional spacing will be applied. The default spacing determined by the font will be used.

3. #h3 { letter-spacing: -0.5px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h3.
Property: letter-spacing: -0.5px;
This reduces the space between each letter by 0.5 pixels, making the text slightly tighter. 
This can be used to create a more compact look for certain designs, but excessive negative spacing might impact readability.


Summary:
#h1: Increases letter spacing by 4 pixels, enhancing visual appeal and readability for headings.
#h2: Uses normal letter spacing, maintaining the default spacing of the font.
#h3: Reduces letter spacing by 0.5 pixels, creating a tighter appearance for the text.
