div {
    height: 200px;
    width: 200px;
    background-color: red;
    border: 3px solid blue;
    padding: 20px;
    box-sizing: border-box; /* Padding is included in the width */
  }
  
/*
The box-sizing: border-box; rule allows the div to maintain its specified dimensions (200px by 200px), 
including the padding and border within those dimensions.


Breakdown of the CSS for the div element:

height: 200px;: This sets the height of the div element to 200 pixels.

width: 200px;: This sets the width of the div element to 200 pixels.

background-color: red;: The background color of the div will be red.

border: 3px solid blue;: This creates a solid blue border with a thickness of 3 pixels on all sides of the div.

padding: 20px;: The padding adds 20 pixels of internal space (inside the border) between the content of the div and the edges of the div.

box-sizing: border-box;:
This property ensures that the padding and border are included in the total width and height of the element.
Normally, the width and height are calculated excluding padding and border, but with box-sizing: border-box;, 
the element's dimensions remain fixed at 200px (both height and width), despite the added padding and border.

Without box-sizing: border-box;
The total size would have been:
Height: 200px (height) + 20px (padding-top) + 20px (padding-bottom) + 3px (border-top) + 3px (border-bottom) = 246px
Width: 200px (width) + 20px (padding-left) + 20px (padding-right) + 3px (border-left) + 3px (border-right) = 246px

With box-sizing: border-box;
The total size remains 200px for both height and width, as the padding and border are included in this calculation.
