/*
In CSS, the font-weight property is used to set the thickness or boldness of text. 
It accepts various values, which can be either numeric or keyword-based. Here are the common options:

Numeric Values
400: Normal (regular) weight. This is the default value for most text.
700: Bold weight. Commonly used for headings and emphasized text.

You can also use values from 100 to 900, where lower numbers indicate lighter weights and higher numbers indicate bolder weights. 
Note that not all fonts support all weights.
Keyword Values
normal: Equivalent to 400.
bold: Equivalent to 700.
bolder: Renders the text bolder than the parent element's font weight.
lighter: Renders the text lighter than the parent element's font weight.

/*
Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rules that set different font weights for various IDs representing headings (#h1, #h2, #h3, #h4, and #h5):

1. #h1 { font-weight: 100; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h1.
Property: font-weight: 100;
This sets the font weight to 100, which is very thin (light). This will render the text as quite light in appearance.

2. #h2 { font-weight: normal; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h2.
Property: font-weight: normal;
This sets the font weight to normal (typically equivalent to 400). This is the default font weight and renders the text at a standard thickness.

3. #h3 { font-weight: bold; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h3.
Property: font-weight: bold;
This sets the font weight to bold (typically equivalent to 700), making the text appear thicker and more prominent.

4. #h4 { font-weight: bolder; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h4.
Property: font-weight: bolder;
This sets the font weight to bolder than the parent element’s weight. The exact appearance depends on the inherited font weight.

5. #h5 { font-weight: 900; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h5.
Property: font-weight: 900;
This sets the font weight to 900, which is the thickest (ultra-bold) style. The text will appear very bold and heavy.

#h1: Very light text with a weight of 100.
#h2: Normal text with a weight of normal (usually 400).
#h3: Bold text with a weight of bold (usually 700).
#h4: Bolder than the parent element's weight.
#h5: Extremely bold text with a weight of 900.
