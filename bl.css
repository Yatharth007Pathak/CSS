/*
In CSS, the line-height property is used to control the amount of space between lines of text (also known as "leading"). 
Adjusting this can improve readability or create visual effects.
Basic Syntax
line-height: value;


Values for line-height

Normal: The default spacing between lines (typically around 1.2 times the font size).
line-height: normal;

Number: Defines a unitless multiplier of the element's font size. For example, 1.5 means 1.5 times the current font size.
line-height: 1.5;

Length: Specifies an exact value using units like px, em, or rem. For example, 20px means the space between lines is fixed at 20 pixels.
line-height: 20px;

Percentage: Specifies line height as a percentage of the current font size. For example, 150% means the line height is 1.5 times the font size.
line-height: 150%;


Best Practices
Use unitless values (e.g., 1.5) because they scale better when font size changes, maintaining proportional line spacing.
Avoid using absolute units like px unless you need a fixed height, as it might not respond well to different screen sizes or font changes.
Consider larger line heights for smaller text or body copy to improve readability, while headings typically need tighter line spacing.

#one {
    line-height: normal;
}

#two {
    line-height: 1.8;
}

#three {
    line-height: 40px;
}

#four {
    line-height: 200%;
}

/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules that set different line heights for various IDs (#one, #two, #three, and #four):

1. #one { line-height: normal; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID one.
Property: line-height: normal;
This sets the line height to the default value defined by the browser, 
which typically provides a comfortable amount of spacing between lines of text, depending on the font size and type.

2. #two { line-height: 1.8; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID two.
Property: line-height: 1.8;
This sets the line height to 1.8 times the font size. A value greater than 1 (like 1.8) increases the space between lines,
which can enhance readability, especially in blocks of text.

3. #three { line-height: 40px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID three.
Property: line-height: 40px;
This sets the line height to a fixed 40 pixels. This value does not depend on the font size, 
meaning regardless of the size of the text, the space between lines will always be 40 pixels.

4. #four { line-height: 200%; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID four.
Property: line-height: 200%;
This sets the line height to 200% of the font size, effectively doubling the space between lines. 
This percentage-based value is similar to the 1.8 value in #two, but it explicitly expresses the height as a percentage of the font size.


Summary:
#one: Uses the browser's default line height, set to normal.
#two: Increases line height to 1.8 times the font size, enhancing readability.
#three: Sets a fixed line height of 40 pixels, which remains constant regardless of font size.
#four: Doubles the line height to 200%, creating significant space between lines.
