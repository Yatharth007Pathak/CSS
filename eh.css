/*
Key Points:

body: text-align: center; centers any inline or inline-block elements in the body.

div: Each div has a height and width of 100px and a 2px black border.

display: inline-block; allows each div to occupy only its defined width and height, making it more flexible within a layout.

#container:
Acts as a flex container with display: flex;, which makes it possible to arrange its children with flex properties.
flex-direction: column-reverse; reverses the natural order of child items, displaying them from bottom to top.

Result:
The container holds five divs stacked vertically in reverse order (box5 at the top, box1 at the bottom), 
with each div having a distinct background color.
The container's layout is columnar, but each div within it aligns according to the column-reverse flex direction. 
The body alignment centers the container itself, while each box within the container maintains its position due to flex alignment.
