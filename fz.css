/*
This CSS code creates an animated div element that changes its background color from aquamarine to red over a specified duration. 
Here's a breakdown of the properties used and how the animation works:

Div Element Styling:
The div is set to have a height and width of 100px, with an aquamarine background color and a black border.
It is positioned absolutely, with its top left corner starting at 100px from the top and left edges of the viewport.

Animation Properties:
animation-name: This specifies the name of the animation to be applied, which is colorAnimate.
animation-duration: The animation lasts for 3 seconds.
animation-timing-function: The animation uses the ease-in timing function, which means it starts slowly and accelerates towards the end.
animation-delay: The animation will start after a 1-second delay.
animation-iteration-count: The animation repeats 5 times.

Keyframes:
The @keyframes colorAnimate rule defines the animation:
The animation starts (from) with the background color set to aquamarine.
It ends (to) with the background color changing to red.

Summary
When this code is applied:
The div will initially appear in aquamarine color.
After a 1-second delay, the background color will start transitioning to red over 3 seconds.
This color transition will repeat 5 times, creating a visually engaging effect.
This animation can be useful in creating attention-grabbing effects in user interfaces or during certain interactions on a webpage.
