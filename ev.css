Explanation of Media Query

Default Styles:
The div element has a default height and width of 100px, with a green background color.

Media Query (@media (min-width: 300px) and (max-width: 700px)):
This query applies when the viewport width is between 300px and 700px.
Under this condition, the background color changes to red.

Summary
In this responsive layout:
The div will appear with a green background on screens smaller than 300px and larger than 700px.
For screen widths between 300px and 700px, the div background color becomes red.

This approach ensures that the element’s appearance adapts based on the device’s screen width, 
improving visual consistency across different screen sizes.
