/*
The p::first-letter rule styles the first letter of a paragraph, making it larger and red.
The p::before rule inserts "Note: " before the content of a paragraph, making the inserted text bold.


Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the CSS rules that target specific parts of <p> elements using pseudo-elements:

1. p::first-letter { font-size: 2em; color: red; }
p::first-letter is a pseudo-element selector that targets the first letter of a <p> element.
font-size: 2em; This increases the size of the first letter to 2 times the current font size of the paragraph.
color: red; This changes the color of the first letter to red.

2. p::before { content: "Note: "; font-weight: bold; }
p::before is another pseudo-element selector. It inserts content before the actual content of a <p> element.
content: "Note: "; 
This specifies the text ("Note: ") that will be inserted before the paragraph content. 
It does not modify the actual HTML, but adds the content visually.
font-weight: bold; This makes the inserted text bold.
