/*
Breakdown of Each div:

#div1:
Height: 50 pixels.
Background Color: Light grey.
Border: 3 pixels solid red.
This div will appear as a small horizontal rectangle with a red border, providing a visual section that is 50 pixels tall.

#div2:
Width: 200 pixels.
Height: 100 pixels.
Background Color: Light blue.
Margins:
A negative top margin of 20 pixels pulls this div upwards, which may cause it to overlap with the element above (if any).
A negative left margin of 10 pixels pulls this div to the left, causing it to overlap with any elements on its left side.
Border: 2 pixels solid blue.
This div will appear larger than the others and will be positioned closer to the top left of its container, 
overlapping with any neighboring elements due to the negative margins.

#div3:
Height: 50 pixels.
Background Color: Light gray.
Border: 3 pixels solid red.
Similar in height and border to #div1, this div will also serve as another section or block but may be positioned below #div2.

Visual Effect:
The layout will consist of three blocks, with #div1 and #div3 being similar in size and style, 
while #div2 being larger and positioned in a way that it overlaps with #div1 due to the negative margins. 
The arrangement will create a layered look, with the red borders of #div1 and #div3 clearly outlining their areas, 
while the light blue #div2 may visually dominate the top left area, depending on its position relative to the others.
