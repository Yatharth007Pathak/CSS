/*
Positioning Breakdown

#box1 (Static Positioning)
Position: static is the default behavior of elements, meaning it follows the normal flow of the document.
Outcome: The element is displayed in its natural order within the page.

#box2 (Relative Positioning)
Position: relative means the element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
Top and Left: The element is offset by 20px down and 10px to the right.
Outcome: It visually shifts but remains in the normal document flow.

#box3 (Absolute Positioning)
Position: absolute removes the element from the normal document flow and positions it relative to its nearest positioned ancestor 
(or the document if none exist).
Top and Left: It is positioned 500px down from the top and 10px from the left.
Outcome: The element is fixed at this absolute position in the layout, floating over other elements.

#box4 (Fixed Positioning)
Position: fixed locks the element to the viewport, so it remains in place even when scrolling.
Top: It sticks to the top of the viewport.
Outcome: The element stays at the top of the page and doesn't move when you scroll.

Visual Impact
#box1 will remain in the normal document flow.
#box2 will be offset 20px down and 10px right from its original position.
#box3 will be placed 500px down and 10px from the left edge of the container.
#box4 will be stuck to the top of the screen, even when the user scrolls.
