/*
In CSS, the word-spacing property is used to control the space between words in a text element. 
This property can be helpful for improving readability or achieving a particular visual design.
Basic Syntax
word-spacing: value;

Values for word-spacing

Normal: The default spacing between words (no additional spacing).

Length: You can specify the spacing using a fixed length, such as px, em, or rem. 
Positive values increase the spacing between words, while negative values decrease it.

Notes
The word-spacing property affects the space between words only, not between individual characters.
Adjusting word spacing can enhance text readability, especially in paragraphs with long words or in certain typographic designs.
Be cautious with negative word spacing, as it can lead to words appearing too close together, making the text harder to read.

#h1 {
    word-spacing: 8px; /* Adds 8 pixels of space between words */
}

#h2 {
    word-spacing: normal; /* No additional spacing */
}

#h3 {
    word-spacing: -2px; /* Reduces space between words by 2 pixel */
}


/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules that set different word spacing styles for various IDs (#h1, #h2, and #h3):

1. #h1 { word-spacing: 8px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h1.
Property: word-spacing: 8px;
This adds 8 pixels of space between each word in the text. 
This can improve readability, especially in headings or larger blocks of text, by providing clearer separation between words.

2. #h2 { word-spacing: normal; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h2.
Property: word-spacing: normal;
This sets the word spacing to normal, meaning no additional spacing will be applied beyond the default spacing determined by the font.

3. #h3 { word-spacing: -2px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h3.
Property: word-spacing: -2px;
This reduces the space between words by 2 pixels, creating a tighter arrangement of words. 
While this can be used for stylistic choices, excessive negative spacing might impact readability.


Summary:
#h1: Increases word spacing by 8 pixels, enhancing clarity and readability in headings.
#h2: Uses normal word spacing, maintaining the default spacing of the font.
#h3: Reduces word spacing by 2 pixels, creating a more compact text layout.
