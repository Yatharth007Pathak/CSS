    height: 100px; /* Sets the height of the div to 100 pixels */

/*
Here's a breakdown of the CSS snippet you've provided:

div {: This selector targets all <div> elements in the document.
height: 100px;: This property defines the height of the div as 100 pixels.
width: 100px;: This property sets the width of the div as 100 pixels.
background-color: red;: This property assigns a red background color to the div.
border: 3px solid blue;: This property creates a solid blue border around the div, which is 3 pixels thick.
margin: 10%;: This property adds a margin of 10% of the width of the parent element around the div. 
The margin is applied equally on all sides (top, right, bottom, left).

Visual Effect:
The resulting div will be a red square, 100 pixels by 100 pixels, with a blue border. The margin will ensure that there is space around 
the div that is 10% of the width of its parent container, allowing it to be visually separated from other elements on the page. 
The actual space around the div may vary depending on the width of the parent element, which affects the 10% margin.
