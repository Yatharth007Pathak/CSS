/*
The transform property in CSS allows you to apply various transformations to an element, such as translation (moving), rotation, 
scaling, and skewing. These transformations can be applied in two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) space, 
enhancing the visual appeal of web pages and user interfaces.
CSS Transform is used to apply 2D and 3D transformations to an element.

Basic Syntax
selector {
  transform: transformation-function(value);
}


Common Transformation Functions

translate: Moves an element from its current position.
2D Translation: transform: translate(x, y);
3D Translation: transform: translate3d(x, y, z);

rotate: Rotates an element around a specified point.
2D Rotation: transform: rotate(angle);
3D Rotation: transform: rotateX(angle) | rotateY(angle) | rotateZ(angle);

scale: Resizes an element.
2D Scaling: transform: scale(sx, sy);
3D Scaling: transform: scale3d(sx, sy, sz);

skew: Skews (distorts) an element along the X and Y axes.
2D Skewing: transform: skew(x-angle, y-angle);

Combining Transformations: You can combine multiple transformations by separating them with spaces


The transform property in CSS is a powerful tool for creating dynamic, interactive designs. By combining various transformation functions, 
you can achieve interesting effects that enhance user experience and improve the visual appeal of your web applications.
