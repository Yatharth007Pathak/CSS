/*
Explanation

General div Style:
All div elements will be styled with a width and height of 100 pixels. 
The margin adds space outside the div, and the padding adds space inside the div.
The display: inline-block; property allows divs to be placed next to each other on the same line while still respecting their width and height.

Specific ID Style:
The #box2 selector targets a specific div with the ID box2 and sets its display to none, which means it will not be visible on the page. 
This element will not occupy any space in the layout, effectively making it disappear.

Visual Representation
Box 1 and Box 3 will be displayed with the specified dimensions, margins, and padding.
Box 2 will not be visible at all because of the display: none; style. It won't affect the layout of the surrounding divs.
