<!--
The <div> tag in HTML is a block-level element that is used to group and organize other HTML elements. 
It does not inherently represent anything specific in the content; instead, it serves as a container for styling and layout purposes. 
Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

Purpose of <div>:
Grouping Elements: It allows you to group multiple elements together to apply styles or manipulate them as a single unit.
Styling: You can apply CSS styles to a <div> to control its appearance, including dimensions, background color, borders, and more.
Layout: It helps in structuring the layout of a webpage, especially when combined with CSS Flexbox or Grid.

In HTML, "Lorem Ipsum" text is often used as placeholder text in designs and layouts. 
It's a nonsensical text derived from Latin that helps visualize how content will appear without focusing on the actual content itself.
