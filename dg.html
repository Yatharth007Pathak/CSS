<!-- Create a navbar for Amazon.in -->

<!--
A navbar (short for navigation bar) is a user interface element commonly found on websites and web applications. 
It helps users navigate through different sections of the site by providing links to important pages or features. 
A navbar is typically placed at the top of a webpage and remains visible as users scroll through the page. 
It often contains links like "Home," "About," "Services," "Contact," and sometimes dropdown menus or search bars.
