/*
Explanation of Changes

Transition Delay:
transition-delay: 1s; adds a 1-second delay before the transition effect begins. This means when the user hovers over the div, 
it will wait for 1 second before starting the transition to the new styles (red background, white text, and increased font size).

How It Works
When you hover over the div, after a 1-second delay, the transition to the new styles (red background and white text) will start, 
taking 2 seconds to complete. The transition will occur in 5 discrete steps due to the steps(5) timing function.
If the user clicks (activates) the div, it will change to dark cyan with yellow text immediately, 
since the :active state does not have any transition delay or timing specified.
