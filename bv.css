/*
The box model in CSS is a fundamental concept that describes how elements are structured and how their sizes 
and spacing are calculated in a webpage layout. Each element on a webpage is represented as a rectangular box, 
and the box model consists of the following components:

Content: This is the innermost part of the box, where text, images, or other elements are displayed.
This is the actual content of the box, such as text, images, or other media. 
The size of the content area can be controlled using properties like width and height.

Padding: This is the space between the content and the border of the box. Padding creates breathing room around the content.
Padding is transparent and can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left) 
using properties like padding-top, padding-right, padding-bottom, and padding-left. Alternatively, you can use the shorthand property padding.

Border: This is a line surrounding the padding (if any) and the content. 
You can set the width, style, and color of the border using properties like border-width, border-style, and border-color. 
The shorthand property border can also be used to set all border properties at once.

Margin: The outermost space surrounding the box. This is the space outside the border of the box, separating it from other elements. 
Margins create space between the element and other elements on the page.
Margins are also transparent and can be set individually for each side using margin-top, margin-right, margin-bottom, and margin-left. 
The shorthand property margin can be used for all sides at once.

Box Model Properties
Width and Height: Set the width and height of the content area.
Padding: Controls the space between the content and the border.
Border: Specifies the width, style, and color of the border.
Margin: Defines the space outside the border.


Understanding Box Sizing (Total Width and Height Calculation)
By default, the Box Model calculates the total width and height of an element as follows:
Total Width = width + padding-left + padding-right + border-left + border-right + margin-left + margin-right
Total Height = height + padding-top + padding-bottom + border-top + border-bottom + margin-top + margin-bottom


Box-Sizing Property
You can change how the Box Model calculates the total width and height using the box-sizing property. The two most common values are:
content-box (default): The width and height only apply to the content, and padding and border are added to the total size.
border-box: The width and height include content, padding, and border, making layout calculations easier.
