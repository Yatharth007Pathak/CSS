a {
    text-decoration: none;
}


/*
This CSS rule sets the text decoration of all <a> elements to none, which effectively removes any underlining. 
This can be useful for achieving a cleaner design, especially when you want links to blend seamlessly with the surrounding text 
or have custom styling applied through other means (like hover effects or background changes).


Breakdown:

a {
This selector targets all <a> elements in the HTML document.

text-decoration: none;
This property removes any default text decoration from the anchor elements. 
By default, anchor elements often come with an underline to indicate that they are links. This rule eliminates that underline.

}
This closing curly brace ends the rule for the <a> selector.
