/*
Background Image Behaviors:

#box1:
background-size: cover: The image will cover the entire area of the div, possibly cutting off parts of the image to fit. 
This maintains the aspect ratio and ensures no empty spaces.

#box2:
background-size: contain: The image will scale to fit inside the div, 
but it might leave empty spaces if the image's aspect ratio doesn't match the div's dimensions.

#box3:
background-size: contain: Same behavior as #box2, but here, background-repeat: 
no-repeat ensures that the image will not repeat itself if the div is larger than the image.

#box4:
background-size: auto: The image will display at its original size. If the image is smaller than the div, 
it will not scale up to fit; if it's larger, it will overflow unless otherwise controlled.

When to Use Each:
background-size: cover: Great for full-background images where cropping isn't a concern.
background-size: contain: Best when you want to display the entire image without cropping, even if that means some empty space.
background-repeat: no-repeat: Used when you don’t want the image to tile or repeat.
background-size: auto: Useful when you want to preserve the natural size of the image and don’t need it to scale.
This approach allows for various ways to handle background images within the same-sized container.
