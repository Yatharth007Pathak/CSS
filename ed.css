/*
Key Points:
height & width: The div is 200px tall and 500px wide.
background-image: The local image 'images/bird.avif' is applied as the background of the div.
background-size: cover: This scales the background image to cover the entire area of the div. 
It maintains the aspect ratio but might crop parts of the image if it doesnâ€™t match the div's dimensions exactly.
position: fixed: This means the div will stay in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
right: 0px: The div is aligned to the right edge of the viewport (0px from the right side).
top: 50px: The div is positioned 50px down from the top of the viewport.

Effects:
The div will remain fixed in the top-right corner of the viewport, even when the user scrolls the page.
The background image will stretch to fully cover the div without leaving any gaps, but parts of the image may be cropped to fit the dimensions.
