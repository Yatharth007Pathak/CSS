div {
    height: 400px;
    width: 400px;
    background-color: aquamarine;
    border: 2px solid black;
    border-radius: 10px;
}

/*
The div is a 400px by 400px square with an aquamarine background, a 2px solid black border, and 10px rounded corners. 
The border-radius property softens the visual appearance by rounding the edges, making the div look smoother and more modern.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule applied to a div element with a focus on the border-radius property:

1. height: 400px;
Property: height
Sets the height of the div to 400 pixels.

2. width: 400px;
Property: width
Sets the width of the div to 400 pixels.

3. background-color: aquamarine;
Property: background-color
The background color of the div is set to aquamarine, giving it a light greenish-blue appearance.

4. border: 2px solid black;
Property: border
Adds a 2-pixel solid black border around the div, creating a sharp, well-defined boundary.

5. border-radius: 10px;
Property: border-radius
Rounds the corners of the div by 10 pixels.
This gives the div softer, rounded corners instead of sharp 90-degree edges.
