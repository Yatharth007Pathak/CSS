/* Child Selector */

div > p {
    color: red;
}

/*
This rule applies a red text color to all <p> elements that are directly inside <div> elements. 
If a <p> element is nested within another element inside a <div> (such as another <div>), it will not be affected by this rule.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule that targets <p> elements that are direct children of <div> elements:

div > p {
The selector div > p is a child combinator selector. It specifically targets all <p> elements that are direct children of <div> elements. 
This means that only <p> elements that are immediately inside a <div> will be affected by this rule, 
not <p> elements that are nested further down in the hierarchy.

color: red;
This sets the text color of the targeted <p> elements to red.

}
The closing curly brace ends the rule for the div > p selector.
