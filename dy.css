/*
This CSS code defines two absolutely positioned boxes (.box1 and .box2) that overlap each other. 
The z-index property determines which box appears on top, with .box2 having a higher z-index, so it will sit above .box1

Visual Layout

.box1 (Light Green Box)
Position: Absolute, meaning it's taken out of the normal document flow and positioned relative to the nearest 
positioned ancestor (or the viewport if no ancestor is positioned).
Z-index: Set to 1, meaning it will appear below .box2.
Size: 200px wide and 100px tall.

.box2 (Light Coral Box)
Position: Absolute, positioned 50px from the left and 50px from the top of the containing element or viewport.
Z-index: Set to 2, so it stacks above .box1.
Size: 150px wide and 75px tall, smaller than .box1.

Overlap Behavior
.box1 is placed at its default position according to the absolute positioning rules.
.box2 is placed 50px to the right and 50px down, overlapping part of .box1 since it's smaller.
Z-index: Since .box2 has a higher z-index, it will appear on top of .box1.
