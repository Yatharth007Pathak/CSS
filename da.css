Breakdown:
div {: This selector targets all <div> elements in the document.
height: 100px;: This property defines the height of the div as 100 pixels.
width: 100px;: This property sets the width of the div as 100 pixels.
background-color: red;: This property assigns a red background color to the div.
border: 3px solid blue;: This property creates a solid blue border around the div, which is 3 pixels thick.
margin: -10px;: This property applies a negative margin of 10 pixels on all sides (top, right, bottom, left). This means the div will overlap
 with neighboring elements or be pulled closer to them, reducing the space around the div by 10 pixels on each side.

Visual Effect:
The resulting div will appear as a red square, 100 pixels by 100 pixels, with a solid blue border around it. 
The negative margin will reduce the space between the div and its neighboring elements by 10 pixels, causing it to overlap with them. 
This can be useful for achieving specific layouts or for correcting spacing issues, 
but it can also lead to unintended overlaps and visual clutter if not managed carefully.
