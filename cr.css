div {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: red;
    border: 3px solid blue;
    padding: 5%; /*5% of the parent element’s width */
}

/*
The div has a 100px by 100px size, a red background, and a 3px blue border. The padding is 5% of the parent container’s width, 
meaning the exact padding size will change depending on the width of the parent element, making the layout more responsive.


Here’s a breakdown of the div element with percentage-based padding:

1. height: 100px;
Property: height
Sets the height of the div to 100 pixels.

2. width: 100px;
Property: width
Sets the width of the div to 100 pixels.

3. background-color: red;
Property: background-color
Sets the background color of the div to red.

4. border: 3px solid blue;
Property: border
Adds a 3-pixel solid blue border around the div.

5. padding: 5%;
Property: padding
The padding is set to 5% of the parent element’s width.
Since padding is defined as a percentage, it scales based on the width of the div's parent container, not its own width. 
For example, if the parent element is 500px wide, the padding would be 5% of 500px = 25px on each side.
