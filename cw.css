/*
The div will occupy a total space of 146px by 146px on the page due to the specified height, width, border, and margin, 
with a red background and a blue border.


Breakdown of the CSS for the div element:

height: 100px;: This sets the height of the div element to 100 pixels.

width: 100px;: This sets the width of the div element to 100 pixels.

background-color: red;: The background color of the div will be red.

border: 3px solid blue;: This creates a solid blue border with a thickness of 3 pixels around the div.

margin: 20px;: This adds a margin of 20 pixels on all sides of the div, creating space between the div and surrounding elements.

Visual Representation:
Content Area: The inner content area of the div has a height and width of 100px.
Padding: There is no padding specified in this case, so the content area occupies the full dimensions of the div.
Border: The div has a 3px blue border, which adds 3 pixels to the outer dimensions of the div.
Margin: The 20px margin creates an additional space outside the border, separating it from any neighboring elements.

Total Dimensions:

Total Height:
Content: 100px
Border: 3px (top) + 3px (bottom) = 6px
Margin: 20px (top) + 20px (bottom) = 40px
Total height = 100px + 6px + 40px = 146px

Total Width:
Content: 100px
Border: 3px (left) + 3px (right) = 6px
Margin: 20px (left) + 20px (right) = 40px
Total width = 100px + 6px + 40px = 146px
