/* Adjacent Sibling Selector */

h1 + p {
    color: red;
}
  

/*
This rule applies a red text color to the <p> element that is immediately following an <h1> element. 
If there are any other elements (like <div>, <span>, etc.) between the <h1> and the <p>, 
or if the <p> is not the first sibling following the <h1>, it will not be affected by this rule.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule that targets <p> elements that are immediately following an <h1> element:

h1 + p {
The selector h1 + p is an adjacent sibling combinator. 
It specifically targets the first <p> element that comes immediately after an <h1> element.
This means that only the <p> directly following an <h1> will be affected by this rule.

color: red;
This sets the text color of the targeted <p> element to red.

}
The closing curly brace ends the rule for the h1 + p selector.
