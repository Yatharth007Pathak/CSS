/*
In CSS, you can align text using the text-align property. Here are the common values:

Left: Aligns the text to the left.
Right: Aligns the text to the right.
Center: Centers the text.
Justify: Stretches the text so that each line has equal width (except the last line).

This property is usually applied to block-level elements like <p>, <div>, <h1>, etc.
*/

p {
    text-align: right;
}


/*
This CSS rule applies a right text alignment to all <p> elements in the document, 
meaning that the text within each paragraph will start from the right side and flow leftward. 
This can be useful for creating specific layout styles, such as for right-to-left languages or particular design aesthetics.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule that applies to <p> (paragraph) elements:

p {
This selector targets all <p> elements in the HTML document.

text-align: right;
This property sets the horizontal alignment of the text within the <p> elements to the right.
As a result, all text in paragraphs will be aligned to the right margin of their containing element (like a <div>, <section>, etc.).

}
This closing curly brace ends the rule for the <p> selector.
