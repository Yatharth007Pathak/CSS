/*
Explanation

body styling:
Sets a default font size of 18px for larger screens.
Uses the Arial font family and a 20px margin around the body for better readability on wider screens.

Media Query (@media screen and (max-width: 480px)):
Targets screens 480px or narrower (typically mobile devices).
Reduces the font-size to 14px for improved readability on smaller screens, preventing the text from appearing too large.

Summary
This media query provides a simple way to ensure the text is readable across devices by adjusting the font size based on screen width. 
Itâ€™s particularly useful for responsive web design to accommodate users on mobile devices.
