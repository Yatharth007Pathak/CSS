In CSS, the font-size property is used to control the size of the text. 
You can set it using different units such as pixels, em, rem, percentages, and more. Here’s a breakdown of how to use it:

Basic Syntax
font-size: value;


Units for Font Size
Pixels (px): Defines a fixed size for the text. This is precise and commonly used unit, but it does not scale with the browser's zoom settings.
Ems (em): Relative to the font size of the element’s parent. If the parent font size is 16px, 1em equals 16px. It's useful for scalable designs.
Rems (rem): Relative to root element (usually <html> element) font size, typically 16px by default. This unit makes scaling more predictable.
Percentages (%): Relative to the parent element's font size. For example, 100% means the same size as the parent element.
Viewport Width (vw): Relative to the width of the viewport (browser window). This unit can be useful for responsive design.
Keywords: CSS provides predefined keywords for common font sizes.
xx-small
x-small
small
medium (default)
large
x-large
xx-large
larger (relative to the parent font size)
smaller (relative to the parent font size)


A pixel (short for "picture element") is the smallest unit of a digital image or display that can be individually controlled and represented 
on a screen. Each pixel represents a single point in a graphic or an image and is usually a square of color.
On standard displays with a pixel density of 96 PPI (pixels per inch), 96 pixels (px) = 1 inch.
This means that on such a screen, there are 96 pixels packed into each inch of the display. 
Therefore, 1px would be equivalent to 1/96th of an inch.

/*
Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rules that set different font sizes for various IDs representing elements 
(#one, #two, #three, #four, #five, and #six):

1. #one { font-size: 1px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID one.
Property: font-size: 1px;
This sets the font size to 1 pixel, making the text extremely small, nearly invisible.

2. #two { font-size: 16px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID two.
Property: font-size: 16px;
This sets the font size to 16 pixels, which is the default size for text in most browsers.

3. #three { font-size: 32px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID three.
Property: font-size: 32px;
This sets the font size to 32 pixels, making the text significantly larger than normal.

4. #four { font-size: 55px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID four.
Property: font-size: 55px;
This sets the font size to 55 pixels, making the text large and bold in appearance.

5. #five { font-size: 78px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID five.
Property: font-size: 78px;
This sets the font size to 78 pixels, making the text very large.

6. #six { font-size: 96px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID six.
Property: font-size: 96px;
This sets the font size to 96 pixels, creating extremely large text, typically used for main headings or titles.
