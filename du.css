/*
Explanation of Positioning

#box1 (Static Positioning)
Position: static is the default position; the element is placed according to the normal flow of the document.
Outcome: #box1 appears normally without any special adjustments.

#box2 (Relative Positioning)
Position: relative means the element is positioned relative to its normal position in the document flow.
Top and Left: It is shifted 20px down and 10px to the right from its default position.
Outcome: The element stays in the normal flow but is visually offset by the top and left values.

#box3 (Absolute Positioning)
Position: absolute positions the element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (or the document if none exist).
Top and Right: The box is positioned 10px from the top and 50px from the right of its nearest positioned ancestor.
Outcome: It is removed from the normal document flow and positioned independently.

#box4 (Fixed Positioning)
Position: fixed positions the element relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in place when the page is scrolled.
Right and Bottom: The box is positioned 20px from the right edge and sticks to the bottom of the viewport.
Width: The box has a width of 100vw, meaning it spans the entire width of the viewport.
Outcome: This element stays fixed at the bottom of the screen, regardless of scrolling.

Visual Layout
#box1 appears in its natural position.
#box2 is shifted down and to the right from where it would normally be.
#box3 is absolutely positioned within its containing block, and will not affect or be affected by other elements.
#box4 sticks to the bottom of the viewport and spans the entire width of the screen.
