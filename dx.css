/*
The z-index property in CSS controls the stacking order of elements that overlap one another. It specifies the position of an element along 
the z-axis (which is the axis perpendicular to the screen), and it only works on elements that have a position value other than static 
(i.e., elements with relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky positioning).

z-index decides the stack level of elements. Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.
Syntax:
element {
  position: value;
  z-index: value;
}

Values:
auto (default): The stacking order is determined by the order of elements in the document.
Positive integer: Higher values place the element in front of others with lower values.
Negative integer: Lower values place the element behind others with higher values.

Important Notes:
Elements with a higher z-index value appear in front of elements with a lower value.
z-index only affects elements that have a position value of relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky
