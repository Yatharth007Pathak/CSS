Generic font families: Generic font families are determined by font family properties such as serifs-which are 
decorative strokes on the ends of letters-or cursive strokes. The generic font family name will specify the attribute 
that all fonts within that family share, like serif, sans-serif, or monospace.

Specific font families: Specific font families are specific fonts with different styles within the one font family name, 
such as Arial, Times New Roman, and Tahoma.


Here is an overview of the generic font families found in many word processing programs:

1. Serif: Serif fonts are traditional typefaces using characters that have serifs which are small winged 
or flared tips extending off the tips of a letter. Serif fonts are typically used in printed books, newspapers, and magazines. 
Some popular serif fonts include Times New Roman, Garamond, Palatino, and Georgia.

2. Sans-Serif: Sans-serif fonts use characters without serifs and are more commonly seen in digital formats. 
A sans-serif font will typically be the default font in digital word processing programs. 
Sans-serif fonts include Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Trebuchet MS, and Gill Sans

3. Cursive: Cursive fonts use characters that have connective strokes which give the font a handwritten appearance. 
Cursive fonts include Comic Sans MS, Adobe Poetica, Sanvito, and Zapf-Chancery.

4. Fantasy: Fantasy fonts are stylized fonts that still maintain the characteristics of non-cursive, traditional alphabet glyphs. 
Examples include Cottonwood, Critter, and Alpha Geometrique.

5. Monospace: Fonts in the monospace font family have characters that are all the same width, giving text the appearance of a manual 
monospaced typewriter. Examples of monospaced fonts include Courier New, Monaco, Lucida Console, Consolas, and Everson Mono.
