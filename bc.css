/* As of CSS3, you can use the shorthand text-decoration property to set multiple values in one line, like this: */

h1 {
    text-decoration: underline red dashed 2px;
}


/*
The CSS rule for <h1> elements combines all the aspects of text decoration into a single line:
It underlines the text with a red, dashed line that is 2 pixels thick.


Breakdown:
h1 {
This selector targets all <h1> elements in the HTML document.

text-decoration: underline red dashed 2px;
This shorthand property sets multiple text decoration properties at once:
underline: This indicates that the text should be underlined.
red: This sets the color of the underline to red.
dashed: This specifies the style of the underline as dashed.
2px: This sets the thickness of the underline to 2 pixels.
