/*
Explanation

Base Styles:
The div is set to a height and width of 200 pixels, with an aquamarine background color and a solid black border.

Transition Effects:
transition-property: all; indicates that all properties that change should be transitioned.
transition-duration: 2s; specifies that the transition will take 2 seconds.
transition-timing-function: steps(5); applies a step transition effect with 5 discrete steps. 
This means that instead of a smooth transition, the properties will change in 5 distinct steps, creating a choppy effect.

Hover Effect:
When the user hovers over the div, the properties transition to:
A red background color.
White text color.
A font size of 20 pixels.

Active Effect:
When the user clicks on the div, it transitions to:
A dark cyan background.
Yellow text color.

Summary
The inclusion of the steps(5) timing function creates an interesting visual effect where the transition appears 
in discrete steps rather than a smooth gradient. This can be visually appealing and can add a unique touch to interactions.
