div {
    width: 300px;                             /* Sets the width of the div to 300px */
    height: 200px;                            /* Sets the height of the div to 200px */
    background-image: url(images/camel.avif); /* Applies the camel image as the background */
    background-repeat: no-repeat;             /* Prevents the image from repeating */
    background-size: cover;                   /* Scales the image to cover the entire div */

/*
Explanation:
background-repeat: no-repeat: Ensures the image will not tile or repeat across the div. Only a single instance of the image will be shown.

background-size: cover: This will scale the image to ensure that the entire div is covered, 
but it might crop parts of the image to fill the area while maintaining its aspect ratio.

background-position: center: Positions the image in the center of the div. 
This is important if the image is being cropped, as it keeps the center of the image visible.

Usage:
This approach is ideal for making sure a background image fits a div without repeating, 
while still maintaining its aspect ratio and keeping the most important part of the image (the center) visible. 
Itâ€™s often used in full-width header images or image cards where visual consistency is key.
