/*
The color property in CSS is used to set the text color of an HTML element. 
It applies to the foreground color of text and can be defined using various color formats.
Syntax:
selector {
  color: value;
}


Common Color Value Formats:

Named Colors: CSS provides a set of predefined color names, like red, blue, green, etc.

Hexadecimal Colors: Colors can be defined using a hex code, which represents the red, green, and blue components of the color. 
The format is #RRGGBB. Example: #FF0000 is red, #00FF00 is green, #0000FF is blue.

RGB (Red, Green, Blue): Colors can be defined using the rgb() function, where the values range from 0 to 255.

RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha): Similar to rgb(), but the fourth value (alpha) specifies the transparency 
(0 is fully transparent, 1 is fully opaque).

HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness): Colors can be specified using hsl(), which represents hue (0-360 degrees on the color wheel), 
saturation (percentage), and lightness (percentage).

HSLA (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha): Similar to hsl(), but includes an alpha channel for transparency.


Important Notes:
The color property only affects the text of the element. To style the background, you use the background-color property.
The color property is inherited, meaning child elements can inherit the text color from their parent unless specified otherwise.

/*
Here’s a detailed breakdown of the CSS rules for each heading (h1 to h6) with different color formats:

1. h1 { color: blue; } (Named color)
The selector h1 targets all <h1> elements.
color: blue; sets the text color to blue using a named color. Named colors are predefined color names recognized by CSS.
Example: The text color will be a simple blue.

2. h2 { color: #3498db; } (Hexadecimal color)
The selector h2 targets all <h2> elements.
color: #3498db; uses a hexadecimal color code to define a specific shade of blue. The code is in the format #RRGGBB, where:
34 is the red value, 98 is the green value, db is the blue value.
Example: The text color will be a shade of light blue.

3. h3 { color: rgb(52, 152, 219); } (RGB color)
The selector h3 targets all <h3> elements.
color: rgb(52, 152, 219); uses the RGB color model, where each color value (Red, Green, Blue) is specified as a number between 0 and 255.
Red: 52, Green: 152, Blue: 219
Example: The text color will be a similar shade of blue as in h2, but this time defined using RGB values.

4. h4 { color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.5); } (RGBA color)
The selector h4 targets all <h4> elements.
color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.5); is similar to the RGB color but adds an alpha (transparency) channel.
52 is the red value, 152 is the green value, 219 is the blue value, 
0.5 is the alpha value (transparency) on a scale of 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).
Example: The text color will be the same shade of blue but with 50% transparency.

5. h5 { color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%); } (HSL color)
The selector h5 targets all <h5> elements.
color: hsl(120, 100%, 50%); uses the HSL color model:
120 is the hue (the color itself) on a scale of 0–360. 120 represents green. 
100% is the saturation (the intensity of the color). 100% is fully saturated.
50% is the lightness (how light or dark the color is). 50% is normal lightness.
Example: The text color will be pure green.

6. h6 { color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.5); } (HSLA color)
The selector h6 targets all <h6> elements.
color: hsla(120, 100%, 50%, 0.5); is the same as HSL but adds an alpha (transparency) channel.
120 is the hue (green), 100% is the saturation, 50% is the lightness, 0.5 is the alpha (transparency) value, meaning 50% transparency.
Example: The text color will be transparent green (50% opacity).

7. button { color: darkmagenta } (Named color)
The selector button targets all <button> elements.
color: darkmagenta; sets the text color to darkmagenta using a named color. Named colors are predefined color names recognized by CSS.
Example: The text color will be a simple darkmagenta.
