/*
Key Points:

div: Defines the general styling for both #box1 and #box2. The height is set to 250px, width to 400px, with a background color of aqua 
and a solid black border. Both elements are positioned using inline-block with a left margin of 200px for spacing.

#box1: The local image (images/sheep.avif) is applied as a background. The background-size: 
contain ensures the image fits within the container, keeping its aspect ratio. 
If the imageâ€™s dimensions don't match the div's, there might be empty space around it.

#box2: Uses an external image URL. The same background-size: contain ensures the external image fits within the div, 
maintaining its original aspect ratio.

Adjustments:
Background Positioning: If the images are not centered, you might want to add background-position: center; to each box for better alignment.
External Image Loading: The external URL (https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/366127.jpg) should work,
but make sure it's accessible and loads properly. You can verify it by testing the URL in a browser or using a reliable image hosting service.
