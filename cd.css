/*
The border property in CSS is used to define the borders around HTML elements. 
You can control the width, style, and color of borders for all four sides of an element. 
It’s a shorthand property that combines multiple border properties or can be used to set individual sides.

1. Shorthand border Property
The border shorthand property allows you to set the border width, style, and color in one line. The syntax is:
border: <border-width> <border-style> <border-color>;

border-width: Defines the thickness of the border (e.g., 1px, medium, thin, etc.).
border-style: Specifies the style of the border (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted, none, etc.).
border-color: Sets the color of the border.


2. Individual Border Sides
You can set borders individually for each side using the following properties:
border-top
border-right
border-bottom
border-left
Each of these properties can be set with a width, style, and color.

3. border-width
The border-width property sets the width of the border. It can take the following values:
Numeric values in px, em, rem, etc. (e.g., 1px, 5px).
Keywords like thin, medium, thick.

4. border-style
The border-style property defines the visual style of the border. It can take the following values:
solid: A single solid line.
dashed: A dashed line.
dotted: A dotted line.
double: Two solid lines.
groove: A 3D grooved border.
ridge: A 3D ridged border.
inset: Appears as if the element is embedded.
outset: Appears as if the element is coming out of the page.
none: No border.

5. border-color
The border-color property sets the color of the border. You can use color names, HEX codes, RGB, or HSL values.

6. border-radius (for rounded corners)
The border-radius property creates rounded corners for the borders of an element.

7. border-image
The border-image property allows you to use an image as the border of an element.

div {
    height: 400px;
    width: 400px;
    background-color: aquamarine;
    border: 5px solid red;
}

/*
The div has a 400px width and 400px height, with an aquamarine background and a 5px solid red border. 
This creates a square div with defined dimensions and a visually distinct border and background.


Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rule applied to a div element:

1. height: 400px;
Property: height
This sets the height of the div element to 400 pixels.
The div will occupy 400px of vertical space.

2. width: 400px;
Property: width
This sets the width of the div element to 400 pixels.
The div will occupy 400px of horizontal space.

3. background-color: aquamarine;
Property: background-color
This sets the background color of the div to aquamarine.
The entire background of the div will be filled with this light greenish-blue color.

4. border: 5px solid red;
Property: border
Adds a 5-pixel solid red border around the div.
The red border surrounds the element, providing a clear visual boundary.
