Visual Representation

Width and Height:
Each div will be 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall.

Margin:
The margin will create 25 pixels of space around each div, separating it from other elements.

Padding:
The padding will create 25 pixels of space inside the div, pushing the content away from the edges. 
This means the actual content area (where text or other elements would go) is smaller than the overall size of the div.

Display Inline:
Since div elements are displayed as inline, they will not create a line break before or after them. 
Multiple divs can sit next to each other horizontally if there is enough space available.


Layout Explanation
Each div will have a total width of 100px (width) + 25px (left margin) + 25px (right margin) = 150px
and a total height of 100px (height) + 25px (top padding) + 25px (bottom padding) = 150px.
If the container width allows, multiple divs will appear side by side due to the inline display property.
If there's not enough space in the parent container, the divs will wrap to the next line, maintaining their inline nature.


Important Note
Inline Display Considerations:
Using display: inline; for div can be counterintuitive since divs are typically block elements. 
If you want to preserve the width and height while also allowing them to line up next to each other, consider using display: inline-block;. 
This will maintain the specified dimensions while still allowing them to sit next to each other.
