/*
In CSS, there are three main types of styling methods that can be applied to HTML elements:

1. Inline CSS:
Definition: Styles are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
Usage: Useful for quick, one-off changes to a specific element but not recommended for large-scale styling 
due to lack of flexibility and maintainability.
Example:
<h1 style="color: red; font-size: 20px;">This is a heading</h1>

2. Internal (Embedded) CSS:
Definition: Styles are placed within the <style> tag in the <head> section of the HTML document.
Usage: Ideal for single-page websites or when styles are specific to that page.
Example:
<head>
  <style>
    h1 {
      color: blue; font-size: 24px;
    }
    p {
      font-size: 16px; color: gray;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

3. External CSS:
Definition: Styles are written in a separate CSS file (usually with a .css extension) and linked to the HTML document using the <link> tag.
Usage: The most efficient method for large websites, as it allows multiple HTML files to use the same stylesheet, 
promoting reusability and easier maintenance.
Example:
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
In the styles.css file:
h1 {
  color: green; font-size: 26px;
}
p {
  color: black; font-size: 14px;
}

4. CSS Frameworks (Optional but Common) :
Definition: Pre-built libraries of CSS rules and components that help streamline styling and layout (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation).
Usage: Used for quickly implementing a consistent design system across pages without writing custom CSS from scratch.
Example (Bootstrap):
<head>
  <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.1.3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <h1 class="text-center">Hello World!</h1>
</body>


Inline CSS: Quick, for individual elements.
Internal CSS: For styling a single page.
External CSS: For global styling across multiple pages.
CSS Frameworks: For rapid development with pre-designed components.

Each method has its own use case, depending on the size and complexity of the project.

h3 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: xx-large;
}

/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each line of the CSS rule for the <h3> element:

h3 {
This is the selector. It selects all <h3> elements in the HTML document. 
The styling rules inside the curly braces {} will apply to these <h3> elements.

color: blue;
This sets the text color of the <h3> element to blue. The color property affects the color of the text.

font-size: xx-large;
This sets the size of the font to xx-large. xx-large is a predefined size value in CSS, 
which scales the font to a large size relative to the default font size of the browser.

}
This closing curly brace marks the end of the CSS rule for the <h3> element.

In summary, the above CSS rule applies to all <h3> tags, giving them blue text and a very large font size.
