Positioning Breakdown

#box1 (Static Positioning)
Position: static, meaning it follows the normal document flow.
Outcome: The element stays in its default position.

#box2 (Relative Positioning)
Position: relative offsets the element 20px down and 10px to the right from its original position.
Outcome: It visually shifts but remains within the document flow.

#box3 (Sticky Positioning)
Position: sticky means the element behaves like relative until the scroll position reaches a specified threshold, 
after which it "sticks" to the specified position.
Top and Left: The element will stick 0px from the top and 30px from the left once the user scrolls past it.
Outcome: It remains "sticky" at the top of the container when scrolling past its initial position, 
giving the effect of a fixed position only after a certain scroll.

#box4 (Fixed Positioning)
Position: fixed locks the element to the viewport, so it doesnâ€™t move even when the page is scrolled.
Top: It stays fixed at the top of the viewport.
Outcome: This element will always be at the top of the page, regardless of scrolling.


Visual Impact
#box1 stays in its normal place, following the document flow.
#box2 is relatively positioned with a slight shift from its normal place.
#box3 initially behaves like relative, but will "stick" to the top of the viewport when you scroll down past it.
#box4 is fixed to the top of the screen and will always be visible as you scroll.


The sticky position for #box3 is useful for elements like headers or menus that stay visible after a certain point in the scrolling.
