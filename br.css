/*
In CSS, the white-space property is used to control how white space inside an element is handled. 
This property can affect the way text is displayed, including line breaks, spaces, and wrapping.

Values for white-space

normal: The default value. White space is collapsed, and lines will wrap as needed. 
This means that sequences of white space are treated as a single space, and text will wrap at the end of the line.

nowrap: Collapses white space as in normal, but prevents line breaks within the text. 
This causes the text to continue on a single line until a <br> element is encountered.

pre: Preserves both white space and line breaks. 
Text will be displayed exactly as it is written in the HTML, including multiple spaces and new lines.

pre-wrap: Preserves white space and line breaks, but also allows text to wrap to the next line as needed. 
This is useful for maintaining formatting while still allowing responsive design.

pre-line: Collapses white space (like normal) but preserves line breaks. 
This means that sequences of white space are collapsed, but new lines in the HTML are maintained.

.normal {
    white-space: normal; /* Default behavior */
}

.nowrap {
    white-space: nowrap; /* No line breaks */
}

.pre {
    white-space: pre; /* Preserves spaces and line breaks */
}

.pre-wrap {
    white-space: pre-wrap; /* Preserves spaces and line breaks, allows wrapping */
}

.pre-line {
    white-space: pre-line; /* Preserves line breaks, collapses spaces */
}

/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules that manage the white-space property for different classes 
(.normal, .nowrap, .pre, .pre-wrap, and .pre-line):

1. .normal
Selector: Targets elements with the class normal.
Property: white-space: normal;
This sets the default behavior for whitespace. 
Text will wrap onto the next line when it reaches the end of its container, and multiple spaces will be collapsed into a single space.

2. .nowrap
Selector: Targets elements with the class nowrap.
Property: white-space: nowrap;
This prevents line breaks in the text. The content will be displayed on a single line, 
and it will overflow its container if it exceeds the width. This can be useful for keeping elements like navigation menus in a single line.

3. .pre
Selector: Targets elements with the class pre.
Property: white-space: pre;
This preserves both spaces and line breaks exactly as they are in the HTML code. 
This is similar to behavior of the <pre> HTML tag, making it useful for displaying code snippets or formatted text where spacing is important.

4. .pre-wrap
Selector: Targets elements with the class pre-wrap.
Property: white-space: pre-wrap;
This preserves spaces and line breaks while allowing the text to wrap to the next line when it reaches the end of the container. 
This is ideal for formatted text that needs to maintain its structure but still be readable.

5. .pre-line
Selector: Targets elements with the class pre-line.
Property: white-space: pre-line;
This preserves line breaks in the text while collapsing multiple spaces into a single space. 
This can be useful for displaying text where the structure of paragraphs is important, but excessive spacing should be avoided.


Summary:
.normal: Uses default whitespace behavior, allowing text to wrap and collapsing spaces.
.nowrap: Prevents line breaks, keeping text in a single line.
.pre: Preserves all spaces and line breaks, maintaining the original formatting.
.pre-wrap: Preserves spaces and line breaks but allows text wrapping to fit the container.
.pre-line: Preserves line breaks while collapsing multiple spaces into one.
