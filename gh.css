/*
Key Points

Centering the Text:
display: flex, along with justify-content: center and align-items: center, centers the text both horizontally and vertically on the screen.

Animation:
The .fade-text class applies the fade animation, which takes 3 seconds with an ease-in-out transition for smooth fading.
infinite means the animation repeats continuously.

Keyframes:
0% and 100% have opacity: 0, making the text hidden at the start and end of each cycle.
50% has opacity: 1, making the text fully visible in the middle of the cycle.
