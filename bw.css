/* 
Height: By default, it sets the content area height of the element
The height property in CSS specifies the height of an element's content area. 
It does not include padding, borders, or margins (unless you use the box-sizing property set to border-box)


Accepted Values for height:

auto:
Default value. The browser calculates the height of the element based on its content.

Length units:
You can specify a fixed height in various units, such as:
Pixels (px): A fixed height in pixels.
Em (em): Relative to the font size of the element.
Rem (rem): Relative to the font size of the root element.
Percent (%): Relative to the height of the parent element.

Percentage (%):
Specifies the height as a percentage of the containing (parent) element's height.

max-height:
Sets the maximum height an element can have. The element will not grow beyond this value even if its content requires more space.

min-height:
Sets the minimum height of an element. The element will not shrink below this value, even if the content is smaller.


Important Notes:
If an element's content is taller than the set height, it may overflow, depending on the CSS overflow property.
When using percentage values for height, the parent element’s height must be explicitly set for it to work.
The height property is essential for controlling the vertical space occupied by elements on your web page.

div {
    height: 200px;
    background-color: aqua;
}


/*
The div element will have a height of 200 pixels and its background will be colored aqua. 
This can be used to create a block of content with a specific height and a visible background color, useful for layout or design purposes.


Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rule that applies styles to a div element:

height: 200px;
Property: height
This sets the height of the div element to 200 pixels.
The div will occupy 200px of vertical space within its container, regardless of its content size.

background-color: aqua;
Property: background-color
This sets the background color of the div to aqua.
The entire background of the div will be filled with this color, making the element visually distinct.
