Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each line in the provided HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
This declaration defines the document type as HTML5. 
It tells the browser that the document is an HTML file, allowing it to be interpreted and displayed correctly.

<html lang="en">
<html>: This tag represents the root element of an HTML document.
lang="en": The lang attribute specifies the language of the document, in this case, English.

<head>
The <head> section contains metadata about the document, such as character encoding, links to stylesheets, and the document title. 
This content is not displayed on the webpage.

<meta charset="UTF-8">
This <meta> tag specifies the character encoding for the document. 
UTF-8 is a universal character set that includes most characters used in writing systems worldwide.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This meta tag ensures that the webpage scales correctly on different devices (like mobile or desktop) 
by setting the width of the viewport to the width of the device and ensuring a 1:1 scale.

<title>Styling methods</title>
The <title> tag sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser tab.

<style>
The <style> tag contains internal CSS to style elements within the HTML document.

CSS inside <style> tag:
h2 { color: green; }: This styles all <h2> elements to have green text.
font-size: xx-large;: This sets the font size of all <h2> elements to be extra-large.

</style>
These closing tags mark the end of the <style> section.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
This <link> tag connects the HTML document to an external CSS file named styles.css. This allows for external styling.

<body>
The <body> section contains the visible content of the webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, and images.

<h1 style="color: red;">Hare Krishna</h1>
<h1>: This tag defines a top-level heading.
style="color: red;": Inline CSS is applied here to make the text "Hare Krishna" red.

<h2>Jai Shri Ram</h2>
This second-level heading (h2) will have green text and an extra-large font size due to the CSS defined in the <style> block.

<h3>Har Har Mahadev</h3>
This third-level heading (h3) is displayed normally without any special inline or internal styling.

</body> and </html>
These closing tags mark the end of the <body> and <html> sections, respectively, completing the document structure.
