This CSS will create a small red square div with a blue border, centered on the page (or within its parent element).


Here's a breakdown of each line of the CSS snippet you've provided:

div {: This targets all <div> elements in the HTML document.
height: 100px;: Specifies that the height of the div should be 100 pixels.
width: 100px;: Specifies that the width of the div should be 100 pixels.
background-color: red;: Sets the background color of the div to red, making it visually stand out.
border: 3px solid blue;: Adds a border around the div that is 3 pixels thick, solid in style, and blue in color.
margin: 0 auto;: This centers the div horizontally within its parent container. 
The 0 sets the top and bottom margins to zero, while auto calculates equal margins on the left and right sides.
