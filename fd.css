/*
Explanation

Base Styles:
The div has a fixed height and width of 100 pixels, an aquamarine background color, and a solid black border. 
The transition properties are set to apply changes smoothly.

Transition Effects:
transition-property: all; specifies that all properties that change (like background color, text color, and font size) should be transitioned.
transition-duration: 2s; sets the transition duration to 2 seconds, meaning any change will occur over this period, creating a smooth effect.

Hover Effect:
When the user hovers over the div, the following changes occur smoothly over 2 seconds:
The background color transitions to red.
The text color changes to white.
The font size increases to 20 pixels.

Active Effect:
When the user clicks (or holds down) the div, it changes to a dark cyan background and the text color shifts to yellow immediately, 
without the transition effect, since this is the :active state.
