/*
In CSS, the direction property is used to specify the direction in which text and other inline elements flow. 
It is particularly important for supporting languages that are read from right to left (RTL), such as Arabic and Hebrew.
Basic Syntax
direction: value;

Values for direction
ltr (left to right): This is the default value, indicating that text flows from left to right. 
This is used for languages such as English, Spanish, and most other Western languages.
direction: ltr;

rtl (right to left): This value indicates that text flows from right to left, which is used for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.
direction: rtl;

inherit: The element inherits the direction value from its parent element.
direction: inherit;


Notes
The direction property can also affect the positioning of punctuation and other text elements.
It is often used in conjunction with the text-align property. For example, when using rtl, you might want to set text-align: right;.
Using the direction property is crucial for creating web pages that support multiple languages and scripts, 
ensuring proper display and readability.

#one {
    direction: ltr; /* Default direction for left-to-right text */
}

#two {
    direction: rtl; /* Direction for right-to-left text */
}

/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules that control text direction for elements with IDs #one and #two:

1. #one { direction: ltr; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID one.
Property: direction: ltr;
Meaning: Sets the text direction to left-to-right (LTR), which is the default direction for languages such as English, Spanish, and many others.
Usage: This is important for ensuring that text is displayed correctly for languages that read from left to right. 
It helps browsers and assistive technologies understand how to render the text properly.

2. #two { direction: rtl; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID two.
Property: direction: rtl;
Meaning: Sets the text direction to right-to-left (RTL), which is typical for languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian.
Usage: This property allows for proper alignment and flow of text in RTL languages, ensuring that the text appears in the correct reading order.


Summary:
#one: The text within this element will be displayed from left to right, which is the standard for many languages.
#two: The text within this element will be displayed from right to left, accommodating languages that follow this reading pattern.
