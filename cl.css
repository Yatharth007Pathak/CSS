div {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: firebrick;
    border: 6px solid blue;
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 50%;
}


/*
The div is a 100px by 100px square with a firebrick background and a 6px solid blue border. 
The border-radius: 50% makes the div a circle, and any text inside the div will be centered horizontally. 
The circular shape with contrasting firebrick and blue creates a bold and visually striking design.


Here's a breakdown of the CSS rule applied to a div element:

1. width: 100px;
Property: width
Sets the width of the div to 100 pixels.

2. height: 100px;
Property: height
Sets the height of the div to 100 pixels.

3. background-color: firebrick;
Property: background-color
Sets the background color to firebrick, which is a dark reddish color.

4. border: 6px solid blue;
Property: border
Adds a 6-pixel solid blue border around the div.

5. text-align: center;
Property: text-align
Aligns the text inside the div to the center horizontally.

6. border-radius: 50%;
Property: border-radius
Rounds the corners of the div to 50%, which transforms the div into a perfect circle (since the height and width are equal).
