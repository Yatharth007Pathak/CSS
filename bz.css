/* 
Width: By default,it sets the content area width of the element. 
The width property in CSS specifies the width of an element's content area. 
Like the height property, it does not include padding, borders, or margins unless the box-sizing property is set to border-box.


Accepted Values for width:

auto:
Default value. The browser calculates the width of the element based on its content.

Length units:
You can specify a fixed width in various units, such as:
Pixels (px): A fixed width in pixels.
Em (em): Relative to the font size of the element.
Rem (rem): Relative to the font size of the root element.
Percent (%): Relative to the width of the parent element.

Percentage (%):
Specifies the width as a percentage of the containing (parent) element's width.

max-width:
Sets the maximum width an element can have. The element will not grow beyond this value even if its content requires more space.

min-width:
Sets the minimum width of an element. The element will not shrink below this value, even if the content is smaller.


Important Notes:
If the content exceeds the set width, it may overflow depending on the overflow property.
When using percentage values for width, the parent element’s width must be explicitly set for it to work.
The width property is vital for controlling the horizontal space occupied by elements, making it essential for responsive web design.

div {
    width: 200px;
    background-color: aqua;
}


/*
The div element will have a width of 200 pixels and its background will be colored aqua. 
This is useful for creating a specific layout, such as a block or container with a fixed width and visible background color.


Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rule that applies styles to a div element:

width: 200px;
Property: width
This sets the width of the div element to 200 pixels.
The div will occupy 200px of horizontal space within its container, regardless of its content size.

background-color: aqua;
Property: background-color
This sets the background color of the div to aqua.
The entire background of the div will be filled with this color, making the element visually distinct.
