/*
This CSS code creates a spinning loader animation, styled as a circular shape with a rotating border. Hereâ€™s how it works:

Loader Styles:
.loader: Sets a circular div with a width and height of 200px.
border-radius: 50%: Makes the div circular.
border: 20px solid #FFE660: Adds a 20px wide yellowish border to the entire circle.
border-top: 20px solid #4ECDC4: Changes the color of the top border to a contrasting teal color, which gives the spinning effect when animated.
animation: spinAnimate 3s ease-in 0s infinite normal;:
3s: Sets the animation duration to 3 seconds.
ease-in: Makes the animation start slowly and speed up.
infinite: The animation loops indefinitely.

Keyframes spinAnimate:
from: Begins with no rotation (rotate(0deg)).
to: Ends with a full 360-degree rotation (rotate(360deg)), completing a circular spin.

This loader spins continuously, simulating a loading effect by rotating the colored top border against the rest of the circle.
