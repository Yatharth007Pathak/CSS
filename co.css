/*
The padding property in CSS defines the space between the content of an element and its border. 
It helps create white space inside the element, giving the content room to "breathe." 
Padding is added inside the element, and it does not affect the size of the border or the margin. 
You can control the padding on each side (top, right, bottom, left) individually or apply a uniform padding to all sides at once.
Syntax:
element {
  padding: value; (Uniform padding)
}

Padding is the space inside the element, between the content and the border.
Margin is the space outside the element, between the border and neighboring elements.


Accepted Values for padding:

Length units:
You can specify padding using units such as:
Pixels (px)
Em (em): Relative to the font size of the element.
Rem (rem): Relative to the font size of the root element.

Percentage (%):
Padding can also be set as a percentage. The percentage is relative to the width of the containing (parent) element.

Auto:
Padding does not support the auto value (unlike margin). You must explicitly define the padding size in units like px, %, etc.


Padding for Individual Sides, You can set padding for each side of an element using specific properties:
padding-top: Sets the padding on the top.
padding-right: Sets the padding on the right.
padding-bottom: Sets the padding on the bottom.
padding-left: Sets the padding on the left.


Padding vs. Margin:
Padding is the space inside the element's border.
Margin is the space outside the element's border, creating space between elements.
You can also use percentage values or mix units (e.g., px, em, %) depending on your layout needs.
