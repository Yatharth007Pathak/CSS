/*
If needed, external or internal CSS can override inline styles by using the !important rule
In this case, even if there's an inline style, the text will be blue because !important takes precedence over inline styles.
*/


p {
    color: blue !important;
}

/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule for the <p> element with the !important declaration:

p {
This is the selector that targets all <p> (paragraph) elements in the HTML document. 
Any styles between the curly braces {} will be applied to those elements.

color: blue !important;
The color property sets the text color of the <p> elements to blue.
!important is a declaration that gives this style the highest priority. 
It overrides any other conflicting styles, even inline styles or other CSS rules with higher specificity. 
It ensures that the color: blue style is applied no matter what other styles might be applied to the <p> element.

}
This marks the end of the CSS rule for the <p> element.

In summary, this CSS rule ensures that all <p> elements will have blue text, 
and the !important makes it difficult for other rules to override this style.

In CSS, comments are added to describe parts of the code, making it easier for you or others to understand the styling decisions. 
Comments do not affect the rendering of the style and are ignored by the browser.
