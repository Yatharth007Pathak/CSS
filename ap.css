/* General Sibling Selector */

h1 ~ p {
    color: purple;
}


/*
This rule applies a purple text color to all <p> elements that are siblings of an <h1> element, no matter how many other elements are
 between them, as long as they share the same parent. It targets all <p> siblings that appear after the <h1>.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule that targets all <p> elements that are siblings of an <h1> element:

h1 ~ p {
The selector h1 ~ p is a general sibling combinator. It targets all <p> elements that are siblings of an <h1> element, 
meaning any <p> that comes after an <h1> element in the same parent container, regardless of how many elements are between them.

color: purple;
This sets the text color of the targeted <p> elements to purple.

}
The closing curly brace ends the rule for the h1 ~ p selector.
