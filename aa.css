CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and format the layout of web pages. 
While HTML provides the structure and content (like headings, paragraphs, images, etc.), 
CSS is responsible for controlling how those elements are displayed to the user.
CSS is a language that is used to describe the style of a document.

Key features of CSS:
Styling: CSS can change the color, font, spacing, size, and positioning of HTML elements.
Layout Control: CSS allows you to create complex layouts, including grid and flexbox layouts, for responsive design.
Responsive Design: It helps websites adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using media queries.
Separation of Concerns: CSS separates content (HTML) from presentation, making it easier to maintain and update.


HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three core technologies of web development, each serving a distinct purpose:

1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
Purpose: Structure the content of a webpage.
What it does: Defines the elements (like headings, paragraphs, images, forms) and organizes the page layout.
Role: It provides the skeleton or foundation of a webpage.

2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
Purpose: Style the webpage and control the visual presentation.
What it does: Manages the layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and overall appearance of HTML elements.
Role: Enhances the look and feel of a webpage.

3. JavaScript:
Purpose: Add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the webpage.
What it does: Allows you to create dynamic features like form validation, animations, user interactions (like clicks), 
and content updates without reloading the page.
Role: It brings the webpage to life by enabling user interaction.

Key Differences:
HTML: Defines the structure of the content.
CSS: Styles and formats how that content looks.
JavaScript: Adds functionality and makes the webpage interactive.
