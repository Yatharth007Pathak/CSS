The first rule sets all links with an href attribute to red.
The second rule overrides the first for links that start with https, setting them to green.
The third rule further overrides for links that contain "google" in the URL, setting them to blue.
The rules are applied based on specificity and which condition is met.


Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the CSS rules that target <a> (anchor) elements based on their href attributes:

1. a[href] { color: red; }
a[href] is an attribute selector that targets all <a> elements that have an href attribute.
This rule sets the text color of any link with an href attribute to red.
Example: This applies to all links like <a href="https://example.com">Example</a>.

2. a[href^="https"] { color: green; }
a[href^="https"] is an attribute selector that targets all <a> elements whose href attribute starts with "https".
The ^= symbol means "starts with."
This rule sets the text color of any link that begins with https to green.
Example: Links like <a href="https://secure.com">Secure</a> will be green.

3. a[href*="google"] { color: blue; }
a[href*="google"] is an attribute selector that targets all <a> elements whose href attribute contains the word "google".
The *= symbol means "contains."
This rule sets the text color of any link that has "google" anywhere in the URL to blue.
Example: Links like <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> or <a href="https://mail.google.com">Google Mail</a> will be blue.
