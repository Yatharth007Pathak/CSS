You can use background-color along with other background properties like 
background-image, background-position, background-size, etc., for more complex background styling.

/*
This rule styles all <div> elements with:
A light blue background. 20px of padding, which adds space between the content and the border. A 2px solid black border around the <div>.


Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the CSS rule for the <div> element:

div {
The selector div targets all <div> elements in the HTML document. The styles inside the curly braces {} apply to these elements.

background-color: lightblue;
This sets the background color of the <div> element to light blue.

padding: 20px;
This adds 20 pixels of padding inside the <div> element, creating space between the content and the edges of the <div>. 
Padding increases the internal spacing, making the content more visually separated from the border.

border: 2px solid black;
This creates a border around the <div>. The border property consists of three values:
2px: The thickness of the border is 2 pixels.
solid: The border style is a solid line (as opposed to dashed or dotted).
black: The border color is black.

}
The closing curly brace ends the rule for the <div> element.
