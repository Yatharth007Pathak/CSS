/*
This CSS code animates a div element by moving it horizontally and changing its background color in three phases. 
Hereâ€™s an explanation of the animation steps and properties:

Animation Properties:
animation: colorAnimate 4s ease-in 1s infinite normal;: The animation is defined with:
4s: The animation duration is 4 seconds.
ease-in: The animation speed starts slower and accelerates.
1s: The animation starts with a 1-second delay.
infinite: The animation loops indefinitely.
normal: Each animation cycle moves forward in the defined keyframe order.

Keyframes for colorAnimate:
0%: At the beginning, the div starts at left: 0px with a background-color of yellow.
50%: Midway, the div moves to left: 300px and changes its background-color to green.
100%: At the end, the div reaches left: 600px with a background-color of red.

This setup produces a smooth transition where the div slides from 0px to 600px over 4 seconds 
while changing colors from yellow to green to red, then resets and repeats continuously.
