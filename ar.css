/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules for styling links when hovered over and paragraphs based on their position:

1. a:hover { color: orange; }
a:hover is a pseudo-class selector that targets <a> (anchor/link) elements when the user hovers their cursor over them.
The :hover pseudo-class applies the style when the user interacts with the link by hovering over it with a pointer device (like a mouse).
This rule changes the text color of the link to orange when hovered over.
Example: Any link, like <a href="#">Link</a>, will turn orange when hovered over.

2. p:first-child { font-weight: bold; }
p:first-child is another pseudo-class selector. It targets the first <p> element that is the first child of its parent.
The :first-child pseudo-class applies to an element that is the first child within its parent container (e.g., within a <div> or <section>).
This rule sets the font weight of the first child <p> to bold.


Summary:
The a:hover rule changes the color of links to orange when the user hovers over them.
The p:first-child rule makes the first paragraph inside any container bold. 
It applies only to the first <p> child within a parent, not subsequent <p> elements.
