element and can be styled in various ways, such as repeated, sized, or positioned according to your design requirements.
Syntax:
element {
  background-image: url('image-path');
}

Values for background-image:
url(): Specifies the path to the image. It can be a relative or absolute URL.
none: Removes the background image.


Additional Properties to Use with background-image:

1. background-repeat: Specifies whether and how the background image repeats.
Values:
repeat: The image repeats both horizontally and vertically (default).
repeat-x: The image repeats horizontally.
repeat-y: The image repeats vertically.
no-repeat: The image doesn't repeat.

2. background-size: Controls the size of the background image.
Values:
cover: Scales the image to cover the entire element (image may be cropped).
contain: Scales the image to be contained within the element (image will not be cropped).
auto: Maintains the original size of the image.
You can also specify dimensions, like background-size: 100px 50px;.

3. background-position: Defines the starting position of the background image.
Values:
top, bottom, left, right, center or a combination like top right.
You can also specify exact positions, like background-position: 10px 20px;.

4. background-attachment: Controls whether the background image scrolls with the page or is fixed.
Values:
scroll: The background image scrolls with the content (default).

/*
The background-size property in CSS is used to control the size of the background image of an element. 
It allows you to specify how the background image is scaled or sized within its container.
Syntax:
element {
  background-size: value;
}

Values of background-size:

auto (default):
The background image retains its original size.
If only one size is specified (like width), the height is automatically adjusted to maintain the aspect ratio.

cover:
Scales the background image to cover the entire element, ensuring that no empty space is left.
The image may be cropped to maintain its aspect ratio.

contain:
Scales the background image to fit completely within the element without cropping.
The entire image will be visible, but there might be empty space if the aspect ratio of the element and the image are different.

Specific Width and Height:
You can explicitly set the size of the background image using specific width and height values, such as in pixels, percentages, or other units.
If you specify only one value, the other dimension will automatically adjust to maintain the aspect ratio.

Percentage Values:
You can use percentages to scale the image relative to the size of the element.
