/*
This rule applies to all elements on the page, changing their text color to pink. 
Any text within the document will appear in pink unless it is overridden by more specific CSS rules.


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule using the universal selector (*):

* {
The asterisk (*) is the universal selector in CSS. It selects all elements in the HTML document, 
meaning the rule inside the curly braces will apply to every element on the page.

color: pink;
This sets the text color of all elements to pink. The color property affects the text color of an element, not its background.

}
The closing curly brace ends the rule for all elements.
