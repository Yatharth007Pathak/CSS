/*
In CSS, the text-indent property is used to specify the indentation of the first line of a text block. 
This is commonly used in paragraphs to create a visual separation or to enhance the overall layout of the text.
Basic Syntax
text-indent: value;

Values for text-indent

Length: You can specify the indentation using a fixed length, such as px, em, or rem. For example, 20px will indent the first line by 20 pixels.

Negative Length: You can also use negative values to pull the first line to the left of the surrounding text.

Percentage: The value can also be specified as a percentage of the width of the containing block.

Notes
The text-indent property only affects the first line of the block element where it is applied. 
Subsequent lines will follow the normal flow without any indentation.
This property can be particularly useful in improving readability in long paragraphs 
or in creating a more structured layout in your text elements.

#h1 {
    text-indent: 30px; /* Indents the first line by 30 pixels */
}

#h2 {
    text-indent: 2em; /* Indents the first line by 2 ems */
}

#h3 {
    text-indent: -5px; /* Pulls the first line to the left by 5 pixels */
}


/*
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rules that set different text indentation styles for various IDs (#h1, #h2, and #h3):

1. #h1 { text-indent: 30px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h1.
Property: text-indent: 30px;
This indents the first line of the text by 30 pixels from the left margin. 
This can help visually separate the first line from the rest of the text and is commonly used in paragraphs and headings.

2. #h2 { text-indent: 2em; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h2.
Property: text-indent: 2em;
This indents the first line of the text by 2 ems. An em is a relative unit that is based on the font size of the element. 
For example, if the font size is 16 pixels, then 2 em would equal 32 pixels. 
This method of indentation is flexible and adjusts according to the font size.

3. #h3 { text-indent: -5px; }
Selector: Targets the element with the ID h3.
Property: text-indent: -5px;
This pulls the first line of the text 5 pixels to the left of the normal position. 
Negative indentation can create interesting visual effects or align text in a specific way, but it may also impact readability if overused.


Summary:
#h1: Indents the first line by 30 pixels, providing a clear visual separation for the heading.
#h2: Indents the first line by 2 ems, making the indentation relative to the font size, which is useful for responsive design.
#h3: Uses negative indentation to pull the first line 5 pixels to the left, which can create a unique design effect.
