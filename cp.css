div {
    height: 100px;
    width: 100px;
    background-color: red;
    border: 3px solid yellow;
    padding: 20px; /* 20 pixels of padding on all sides */
}


/*
The div has a 100px width and 100px height, a red background, and a 3px solid yellow border. 
The 20px padding increases the space inside the div around its content. 
The actual space taken up by the element will be larger than 100px due to the padding and border, making it 166px by 166px overall.


Here's a breakdown of the CSS rule applied to a div element:

1. height: 100px;
Property: height
Sets the height of the div to 100 pixels.

2. width: 100px;
Property: width
Sets the width of the div to 100 pixels.

3. background-color: red;
Property: background-color
Sets the background color of the div to red.

4. border: 3px solid yellow;
Property: border
Adds a 3-pixel solid yellow border around the div.

5. padding: 20px;
Property: padding
Adds 20 pixels of padding to the inside of the div on all sides (top, right, bottom, and left).
The padding adds space between the content inside the div and its border, creating extra space inside the element.
