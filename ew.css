Explanation of Media Query
Media Query (@media screen and (max-width: 400px)):
This query is applied only to screen devices (as opposed to print or other media types).
It activates when the screen width is 400px or less, typically affecting smaller mobile devices.
The body background color changes to lightcoral within this width range, giving the page a different look on small screens.

Summary
This media query is an efficient way to make subtle design adjustments for small screens, 
enhancing the user experience by improving contrast, readability, or visual appeal based on screen size.
