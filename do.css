Explanation

Common Styles for All Divs (div):
Width and Height: Each div is set to 100 pixels in both width and height, creating a square shape.
Margin: A margin of 25 pixels is applied around each div, creating space between the divs.
Padding: Padding of 25 pixels is added inside each div, providing space between the content (if any) and the div's border.
Display: The inline-block property allows divs to sit next to each other while respecting their defined dimensions. 
This is different from block, which would make each div start on a new line.

Specific Styles for #box2:
Visibility: The visibility: hidden; property hides #box2 from view but keeps it in the document flow. 
This means it will still take up space as if it were visible, so the surrounding layout won't change, but it won't be rendered on the screen.


Visual Outcome
Box 1 and Box 3 will be displayed as visible squares with their respective background colors and will be spaced apart due to the margin.
Box 2 will not be visible, but the space it would occupy will remain, affecting the positioning of the surrounding elements.


Key Points
The visibility: hidden; property is different from display: none;. If you use display: none; instead, 
the element will be completely removed from the document flow, and other elements will move into its place.
The combination of padding, margin, and inline-block allows for precise control over layout and spacing.
