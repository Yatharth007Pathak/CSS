/*
CSS provides a variety of text properties that allow you to control the appearance and layout of text in your HTML elements. 
These properties let you style the font, alignment, spacing, decoration, and transformation of text. Here are some key text properties in CSS:

1. color: Defines the color of the text.

2. font-family: Specifies the font type for the text. You can provide a list of fonts as fallback options.

3. font-size: Sets the size of the text. It can be in various units like pixels (px), ems (em), rems (rem), percentages (%), or points (pt).

4. font-weight: Defines the boldness of the text. You can specify values like normal, bold, or numeric values (100 to 900).

5. font-style: Sets the style of the font, such as normal, italic, or oblique.

6. text-align: Aligns the text horizontally within its containing element. Values include left, right, center, or justify.

7. text-decoration: Adds decorative features like underlines, overlines, line-throughs, or no decoration.

8. text-transform: Controls the capitalization of text. It can be set to uppercase, lowercase, 
or capitalize (capitalizes the first letter of each word).

9. letter-spacing: Sets the spacing between individual letters (characters). The value is usually in pixels (px) or em units (em).

10. word-spacing: Controls the space between words. The value is typically in pixels (px).

11. line-height: Defines the space between lines of text. It can be set using a number, percentage, or unit.

12. text-indent: Indents the first line of text within an element. Itâ€™s typically used in paragraphs.

13. white-space: Controls how white space inside an element is handled. Common values are normal, nowrap, pre, and pre-wrap.
normal: Collapses consecutive white spaces (default).
nowrap: Prevents text wrapping.
pre: Preserves white spaces and line breaks.
pre-wrap: Preserves white spaces but allows wrapping.

14. text-shadow: Adds a shadow effect to the text. The values are typically horizontal offset, vertical offset, blur radius, and color.

15. direction: Specifies the direction of the text. It can be ltr (left-to-right) or rtl (right-to-left).
