/*
Explanation of Styles

Navigation Bar (.navbar):
Flexbox Layout: Using display: flex, the .navbar creates a flexible layout for its child elements (typically <a> or <li> elements).
Even Distribution: justify-content: space-evenly ensures that all items in the navbar are evenly spaced, 
with equal space on both sides of each item.

Anchor Links (a):
No Underline: The text-decoration: none property removes the default underline from links.
Black Text: The text color is set to black, providing a clear contrast against the navbarâ€™s pink background.

List Items (li):
No Bullets: The list-style-type: none property removes bullet points from the list items.
Aqua Background: Each list item has a light aqua background, making it visually distinct.

Outer Container (.outer):
Fixed Size: The .outer div has a fixed height and width of 400 pixels, creating a square container.
Centered Layout: Using display: flex, justify-content: center, and align-items: center, 
any child elements (like the .inner div) will be perfectly centered within this container.
Background Color: The cornflower blue color provides a visually appealing backdrop.

Inner Container (.inner):
Smaller Square: The .inner div has a height and width of 100 pixels, making it smaller than the outer div.
Distinct Color: The dark orchid background color adds contrast to the outer div.

Visual Outcome
In a typical HTML structure, this CSS will create a navigation bar at the top with evenly spaced links or list items. 
Below the navigation bar, there will be a square container (the outer div) with another smaller square (the inner div) centered within it. 
The colors will provide a vibrant aesthetic, with a pink navbar, aqua list items, 
and a cornflower blue outer div surrounding a dark orchid inner div.
