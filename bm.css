/*
Breakdown:

p {
This selector targets all <p> (paragraph) elements in the HTML document.

line-height: 2px;
line-height: This property sets the height of each line of text within the paragraph.
2px: This sets the line height to a fixed value of 2 pixels.

Implications:
Setting the line height to 2 pixels is quite low and may result in very cramped text. 
In most cases, such a small line height can lead to overlapping text, making it difficult to read.
It's generally recommended to use line height values that are larger than the font size to ensure readability. 
Common values are often between 1.2 and 1.5 times the font size, but fixed pixel values can also be used when designing specific layouts.
