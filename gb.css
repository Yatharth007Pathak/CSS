/*
In this code, the div element animates from a starting position of left: 0px with a yellow background color 
to an ending position of left: 600px with a red background color. Key elements of this animation include:

Animation Setup: The animation shorthand property applies the animation named colorAnimate, setting its duration to 2s, 
timing function to ease-in, delay to 0s, and iteration count to infinite, allowing it to repeat indefinitely.

Keyframes: The @keyframes colorAnimate rule defines the animation's movement and color change. 
It moves the div horizontally from left: 0px to left: 600px and changes its background color from yellow to red.

This setup creates a looping animation where the div shifts across the screen while its color transitions from yellow to red over each cycle.
