/*
This rule applies a green text color to all <p> elements that are within <div> elements. 
If a <p> element is not contained within a <div>, it will not be affected by this rule


Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the CSS rule targeting <p> elements that are inside <div> elements:

div p {
The selector div p is a descendant selector. It targets all <p> elements that are descendants (children, grandchildren, etc.) of <div> elements. 
This means that only paragraphs inside a <div> will be affected by this rule.

color: green;
This sets the text color of the targeted <p> elements to green.

}
The closing curly brace ends the rule for the div p selector.
