/*
Explanation

Base Styles:
The div is initially styled with a height and width of 100 pixels, an aquamarine background, and a 2-pixel solid black border.

Hover Effect:
When the user hovers over the div, the background color changes to red and the text color changes to white. 
This visual cue indicates that the div is interactive.

Active Effect:
When the user clicks (or holds down) the div, it changes to a dark cyan background and the text color shifts to yellow. 
This effect provides feedback that the element is being actively interacted with.
