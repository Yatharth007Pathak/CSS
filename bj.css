Responsive Font Size
To make your font sizes responsive, consider using units like em, rem, or vw

/*
This rule makes the font size of the <h1> element responsive. It adjusts dynamically based on the viewport width, 
ensuring the text scales well on different screen sizes, from small mobile devices to larger desktop displays. 
The use of vw units helps create adaptable layouts that enhance the user experience on various devices.


Breakdown:

h1 {
This selector targets all <h1> elements in the HTML document.

font-size: 2vw;
font-size: This property sets the size of the font for the <h1> element.
2vw: This unit stands for 2% of the viewport width.
Viewport width (vw) refers to the width of the browser window or screen.
In this case, the font size of the <h1> element will be 2% of the current width of the viewport. 
As the viewport (window) resizes, the font size will dynamically adjust to maintain a proportionate size relative to the width of the screen.

}
This closing curly brace ends the rule for the <h1> selector.
