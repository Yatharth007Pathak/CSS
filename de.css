Explanation of Each Element

div Styles:
Height & Width: The div has a fixed height and width of 100 pixels.
Background Color: The background color is blue.
Border: It has a solid yellow border that is 3 pixels thick.
Margin: A margin of 20 pixels is applied to the bottom, which creates space below the div and separates it from any subsequent content.

p Styles:
Height & Width: The paragraph element also has a fixed height and width of 100 pixels.
Background Color: The background color is green.
Border: It has a solid red border that is 3 pixels thick.
Margin: A margin of 10 pixels is applied to the top, which creates space above the p element, separating it from any preceding content.

Resulting Layout
The blue div will appear at the top, with a yellow border and a bottom margin of 20 pixels.
The green p element will appear below the div, with a top margin of 10 pixels and a red border.
This layout allows the div and p elements to maintain clear separation and visually distinct backgrounds and borders.
