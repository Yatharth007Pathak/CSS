Visual Representation
div Element:

The div will have a pink background.
It will behave like an inline element, meaning it will not start on a new line and will only take up the space required by its content. 
Other inline elements (like text or other inline divs) can sit next to it.

button Element:
The button will be displayed as a block element, meaning it will start on a new line and take up the full width available to it. 
This will cause any subsequent elements to appear below it.
