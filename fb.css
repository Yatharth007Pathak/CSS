CSS transitions allow you to smoothly change CSS property values over a specified duration, 
creating animations for elements when they change states (such as on hover, focus, or click).
Transitions enables you to define the transition between two states of an element.

Basic Syntax
To create a transition, you use the transition property on an element:
selector {
  transition: property duration timing-function delay;
}


Key Components of Transitions

property: The CSS property you want to animate (e.g., width, background-color, opacity). 
You can use all to apply transitions to all properties that change.

duration: The time the transition should take to complete, usually in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms). Example: 0.5s.

timing-function: Defines the speed curve of the transition effect. Common values include:
ease (default): Starts slowly, speeds up, then slows down at the end.
linear: Maintains the same speed from start to end.
ease-in: Starts slowly and speeds up towards the end.
ease-out: Starts fast and slows down towards the end.
ease-in-out: Starts and ends slowly.
cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2): Custom speed curve.
delay: The amount of time to wait before starting the transition.


Common Transition Use Cases
Hover Effects: Smoothly change color, size, or opacity.
Buttons and Links: Transitions on hover can make interactions feel more responsive.
Images: Smoothly zoom or adjust image brightness.
Dropdowns and Modals: Fade in and out for visibility transitions.
