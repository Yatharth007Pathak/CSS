/*
The margin property in CSS defines the space outside an element's border, separating it from surrounding elements. 
Margins create space between the border of an element and neighboring elements, unlike padding, which is space inside the border.
It controls the spacing between the current element and adjacent elements, helping to position them on the page.
Syntax:
element {
  margin: value;
}


Accepted Values for margin:

Length units:
You can specify margin using units such as:
Pixels (px)
Em (em): Relative to the font size of the element.
Rem (rem): Relative to the font size of the root element.

Percentage (%):
You can set margin as a percentage. The percentage is relative to the width of the containing (parent) element.

auto:
The value auto is often used to center elements horizontally. 
It tells the browser to calculate the margins automatically to equally distribute space on both sides of the element.

Negative values:
Margins can take negative values, which pull elements closer together or overlap elements.

Margins for Individual Sides, You can apply different margins to each side of an element using specific properties:
margin-top: Sets the margin on the top of the element.
margin-right: Sets the margin on the right of the element.
margin-bottom: Sets the margin on the bottom of the element.
margin-left: Sets the margin on the left of the element.


Collapsing Margins:
Margins on adjacent elements can collapse, meaning they overlap rather than add up. 
This applies to vertically adjacent elements where the margin of the greater value will be used.
Margins can also collapse, meaning the larger margin between two adjacent elements is used, rather than the sum of their margins.


Difference Between Margin and Padding:
Margin is the space outside an element, between its border and other elements. Margin controls the space outside an element’s border.
Padding is the space inside an element, between its content and border. Padding controls the space inside an element’s border.
