/*
inline CSS has higher specificity than external CSS or other types of styles, meaning it will override external or internal styles when 
applied to the same element. This happens because of the CSS specificity hierarchy. Here’s a breakdown of how specificity works:

CSS Specificity Hierarchy (from lowest to highest):
External CSS (or styles in an external .css file).
Internal/Embedded CSS (styles within the <style> tag in the HTML document).
Inline CSS (styles directly within an element’s style attribute).
Important Rule (!important declarations override everything except another !important with higher specificity).

Key Points:
Inline CSS is more specific because it’s applied directly to the element.
While inline styles can be useful for quick overrides or one-off changes, they reduce the maintainability of the code, 
as they override external or internal styles and make it harder to manage styles across a large site.

p {
    color: blue;
}

/*
Here’s a breakdown of the CSS rule for the <p> element:

p {
The selector p selects all <p> (paragraph) elements in the HTML document. 
Any styling rules within the curly braces {} will apply to these <p> elements.

color: blue;
The color property sets the text color of the <p> elements to blue.

}
The closing curly brace marks the end of the CSS rule for the <p> element.

In summary, this CSS rule applies to all <p> elements, changing their text color to blue.

/*
To run a CSS file, you'll typically include it in an HTML file, as CSS is used for styling HTML content. Here’s how you can do it:

1. Create an HTML File: First, create an HTML file where you will link your CSS file e.g index.html

2. Create a CSS File: Now, create a CSS file that you want to link to your HTML e.g styles.css

3. Open the HTML File in a Web Browser:
Open the HTML file (e.g. index.html) in a web browser by double-clicking it or right-clicking and selecting "Open with." 
or simply click Go Live on your HTML file to run live server.
You should see the styled content as defined by your CSS file.

4. Using Online Editors: You can also run CSS code using online platforms like:
CodePen (https://codepen.io/)          JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/)          JSBin (https://jsbin.com/)
Simply create a new project, paste your HTML and CSS code, and see the results immediately.
This method will allow you to see how your CSS styles are applied to HTML elements.
