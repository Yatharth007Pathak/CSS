/*
Explanation

Box 1 (#box1):
The height is set to 100px and the width to 200px, creating a rectangular shape.
The background is pink.
The text inside has a font size of 10px, which is a small text size.

Box 2 (#box2):
The height is 50px.
The background is yellow.
The left margin is set to 10%, which moves the box 10% of the width of its parent container from the left.
The text inside the box has a font size of 2em, meaning it is 2 times the default size of the parent element. i.e, 20px.
The width is set to 5em, meaning it is 5 times the element's font size. 
Since the font-size is 2em, this results in a total width of 5 times the element's font size. i.e, 100px.
