/*
The visibility property in CSS is used to control the visibility of an element on a webpage. 
It determines whether an element is visible or hidden, but unlike the display property, it does not remove the element from the document flow. 
This means that when an element is set to be invisible, it still occupies space in the layout.


Common visibility Values:

visible:
The default value. The element is visible.

hidden:
The element is not visible, but it still takes up space in the layout. Other elements will not shift to fill the space.

collapse (specific to table elements):
This value applies only to table rows (<tr>) and table columns (<col>). 
It makes the row or column invisible and collapses the space they occupy.


Comparison with display Property:
visibility: hidden;:
The element is hidden but still takes up space in the layout.
display: none;:
The element is removed from the document flow and does not take up any space.
